Foot Nerd dialogue covenant [last edited 1.19.23]

--

We remain open minded and enter conversations with a willingness to change our minds if the information presented is compelling

We approach conversations as opportunities to learn, not simply to defend our current position 

We are clear on the idea/perspective we are presenting

We let the other person be heard, avoid interrupting them, and allow for equal opportunity to speak

We engage in conversations with good faith: the mutual desire to understand the opposing perspective and to collaboratively achieve a synergy 
between viewpoints to resolve differences and discover the most valid perspective based on well reasoned arguments

We avoid presenting non-testable assertions. All arguments must be falsifiable

We understand the difference between disagreement (not agreeing with someone's idea) and dislike (showing contempt for the person with the idea)

We avoid the use of logical fallacies [https://www.pesec.no/24-most-common-logical-fallacies/]
 
We are compassionate with ourselves and others. Weâ€™re all on the same team and doing our best
