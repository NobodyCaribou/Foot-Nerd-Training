1 ------- INTRO

Hello beautiful humans. Thank you for being here and welcome to Foot Nerd Training orientation

I'm Nick and I'm here with Ruth to officially welcome you all and to review important points within orientation to make sure you're ready to officially
begin your 12 weeks of training

If you haven't already, we recommend reading the github orientation file first, then watch this video and take notes

This will be a high level overview and an opportunity for us to unpack a few important elements for your journey ahead



2 ------- ROADMAP

Let's start with the training roadmap. Zoomed out outline of the 12 weeks:

- 6 weeks restoring excellent foot health
- 1 week reviewing notes and sharing/discussing with peers
- 3 weeks learning how to deliver a TFC workshop and earn income by offering a workshop to your community
- 1 week understanding what it means to be a health leader in your community (Healthnode)
- 1 week debriefing from your experience and preparing your POW submission to complete FNT

Be playful, seek support, your output of the next 12 weeks is based on your inputs

Put lots of energy in, you will get lots from it



3 ------- WHAT IS A FOOT NERD?

In really simple terms, a foot nerd is someone who takes excellent care of themselves and finds purpose and meaning in helping others do the same

We lead through action and arent afraid to share our stories to inspire others

We're curious

We're fascinated by feet and use foot health as a gateway to 6 pillar health

We enjoy good faith, productive disagreement and care more about learning than being right

We think for ourselves, respect one another and use the scientific method as a tool to discover truth



4 ------- POW

Why? How we hold ourselves accountable for doing the work and engaging with the learning process, how we have our work witnessed by a peer

How? By taking notes everyday and then summarizing our most memorable experinces and key insights into 3 pages for a peer to review

What? 3 pages proof of work submission guideline: 1 page summary of weeks 1-6, 1 page summary of weeks 7-12, 1 page workshop plan/debrief


See orientation github file for submission details. 3 pages total. Bullet points are welcome. Distilled summary of your 12 week experience


Ruth: daily pow - spectrum of effort


5 ------- SLACK & GITHUB

Slack - why we use slack, tips on using it, keeping in context

Github - why we use it, accessing materials



6 ------- LAYER 2

Why we record L2 conversations

Examples of what to record



7 ------- DIALOGUE COVENANT 

Why it's an important document. Creating a safe space for debate and dialogue

Preferring to learn than to be right. Respectful, good faith conversations. A respectful space

Why productive disagreement is so important



8 ------- TFC Monthly zoom calls

Why we do them, what we cover, how to participate (where we post zoom links and questions)



9 ------- Nerd discounts at TFC store

Main store only, possible discounts on bulk orders - inquire if questions



10 ------- WEEK 11: DELIVER YOUR WORKSHOP

Why we're mentioning this now

Preparing by deeply understanding the process of restoring healthy feet and taking notes so you can share your experience

Begin telling people about your workshop now, start planning



11 ------- FEEDBACK

Constantly evolving and improving the experience
