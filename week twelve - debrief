Welcome to week 12 of foot nerd training and congratulations on making it here. 

This week is all about reflection. De-brief yourself on the past 11 weeks and prepare your proof of work submission to complete training

We cover:

1) Checklist of tasks for the week
2) POW submission guidelines
3) Writing your foot directory bio

Objective: Reflect on your journey to date, lessons learned, challenges faced & results achieved

Tasks: 
- Full review of notes taken during foot restoration journey, workshop training, healthnode training & your experience delivering a workshop
- Prepare POW submission to complete training
- Write a brief plan about your next few months. Milestones you want to achieve, aspirations you want to work towards
- Celebrate your achievement
- Craft your foot nerd bio to be listed within our global directory of nerds once you have completed training

Debrief yourself. Send us feedback about what you liked and what we can improve within FNT. Submit resources to the library

Submit your proof of work to complete your training. 3 pages. No approval/grading - A nerd helper will review your work and witness you completing training

What is a debrief?

1 written page summarizing:

- What you learned
- What you accomplished
- Insights you reached
- Challenges you faced and how you overcame them
- The path forward: what you want to do as a foot nerd
- Feedback to improve foot nerd training


- Synthesis: review (re-read) your notes, process the information (extract out the gems), summarize insights, integrate into your life and take notes on
the challenges with integration and ongoing thoughts about wisdom being applied

- Raw data -> secondary filter to keep 30% -> process and integrate the top 30% to yield 5% wisdom gems (heuristics) that you implement and share


8 ------- WRITING YOUR FOOT NERD DIRECTORY BIO

As a way to recognize each foot nerd that has completed training, we will be creating a global directory of foot nerds at www.tfcFootNerd.com

This directory will also be used by members of the global TFC family to find foot nerds who can help them

This is your first impression to the world and how you find the people you want to work with

Please submit your bio in the #week12 channel on slack so we can upload it to the website
