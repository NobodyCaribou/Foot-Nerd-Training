1 ------- ROADMAP

Schedule for the next 12 weeks:

Week 1-6        Restoring healthy feet
Week 7          Integration: Reviewing notes and sharing/discussing with peers on Slack
Week 8-10       Workshop training (Continue your physical training, experiments and screens through week 12)
Week 11         Healthnode training, deliver your workshop
Week 12         Complete your final rescreens, Debrief your experience, submit proof of work


Thank you for your commitment. Thank you for leading by example

What you get out of the next 12 weeks is directly related to the energy you put into the learning journey

The next 12 weeks will challenge you to be consistent with 1 daily hour of focused learning

You are not alone on this journey. Foot nerds are here to support you, witness your journey and to inspire you

We wish you an enjoyable, playful, rewarding 12 week journey and are grateful to have you as part of our global family



2 ------- WHAT IS A FOOT NERD?

A foot nerd is someone who:

- Explores health deeply, starting with their feet
- Spends time barefoot
- Leads by example
- Takes excellent care of themselves
- Makes income helping others restore excellent health starting with feet

We love to play, are open minded, enjoy good faith disagreements and invest energy everyday into our health

We find purpose in being health resources for our local communities (Healthnodes within the global TFC network)

We feel it's always better to learn than to be right

We view science as the adult word for play

We understand that science is not a perfect tool but it's the best one we have right now for determining truth



3 ------- PROOF OF WORK (POW)

Proof of work is how we keep ourselves accountable over the next 12 weeks 

It's the concrete proof that we showed up everyday and completed the commitment we set for ourselves

Two components:
- Daily note taking in our POW log (covered further in week 1)
- POW submission to complete training 

After 11 weeks of work, we compile, process and distill widsom from the raw data we record daily in our notes

The result of our synthesis done in week 12 is a 3 page document that is then submitted for a peer to review

Once reviewed, you will receive a certificate of completion and digital logos and graphics to use in your work. 
Lifetime access to a world class network of extraordinary Foot Nerds who are interested in the same work you are.
Lifetime access to upgrades to FNT and any other digital protocols you'd like to use to continue on your health journey. 
The Foot Nerd Experience is a year long deep dive in the 6 pillars of health and would be a complimentary next step for you. 

There is no grading/evaluation. You become an authority on foot health by  review your submission is about having someone witness your journey

POW submission guideline:
- Proof of work data sheet completed week 1, week 6 & week 12
- Workshop debrief (1 page max)


4 ------- SLACK & GITHUB

Slack is our virtual town square in cyberspace where foot nerds from around the globe connect with one another

It's the plaform we use to seek help from each other and to share our proof of work

There are dedicated channels for each week. Please keep in context by engaging in the correct channel based on where you are in your 12 weeks

For private conversations, connect with other nerds via direct messages

Use the feedback channel to let us know how we can make foot nerd training better for you and for future nerds 

--

Github is where we host all foot nerd training content

It's a robust platform that allows us to continually update and evolve the materials covered during training

Each week of training has it's own Github file which contains the content for that week

Library: a categorized repository of resources curated and created by foot nerds

Experiments: a searchbase of experiment templates categorized by screen for you to choose from

Dialogue covenant: The document that governs how we have conversations and disagreements within the foot nerd community (covered further in point 6)


5 ------- DIALOGUE COVENANT

This is our shared agreement that governs how foot nerds interact with one another in dialogue. Our rules of engagement for discourse
                                   
Created, edited and upheld by foot nerds

It’s our intention to create and maintain a productive space for intellectual disagreement and generative conversations

We aspire to become a community of individuals who can respectfully challenge each others perspectives and where each indidivual is heard

Together we maintain a safe environment for discourse, underlined by love and understanding

We’re here to learn from each other and contribute our varied experiences and backgrounds to the collective knowledge base

In doing so, we create diversity. Diversity is important because a wide variety of perspectives breeds immunity from bias

We work towards a space where fear is eliminated and every nerd is safe to speak what he/she believes to be true without the danger of repercussions


What this means for you:

Each nerd agrees to help foster a safe environment for discourse and debate

We will use Slack and Zoom (as needed) as forums where we can have discussions on controversial topics

When topics come up and nerds want to have a debate/discussion, a temporary channel will be created on Slack and the discourse will be held there

If a Zoom call is appropriate, nerds can propose, announce and schedule discussions that are open for all foot nerds to participate in

When needed, a mediator will lead the conversation and the discussion covenant will be enforced objectively by every participant involved


All nerds agree that conversations will be conducted with respect, will be constructive and that each person involved is participating in good faith

Good faith can be defined as: 

Contributing to the discussion honestly and fairly and agreeing to follow the guidelines for creating an environment of safety and trust

Everyone who agrees to the covenant (aka agreement) is also an arbiter to ensure that it is respected and enforced

It protects everyone within the space. The covenant is an evolving document

You can view the current version by selecting the dialogue covenant file from the README summary



6 ------- MONTHLY LIVE FIRESIDES

A chance to gather on zoom as a global community

Answer community questions, nerd out on feet, unpack a topic

Have beautiful disagreements in our quest for truth

8 ------- Week 11: DELIVER YOUR EVENT

An imporant part of foot nerd training is bringing people together and sharing your understanding with others

In week 11 (or close to then) you will organize an event for your local community and earn income from the value you deliver

Your event can be a [shoes optional] walk or a more formal workshop

Although 11 weeks seems like a long time from now, the earlier you begin planning your session, the better preprared you will be

Knowing you will be sharing your newly acquired foot health wisdom with others creates deeper meaning in your learning journey over weeks 1-6

You aren't just taking daily notes for yourself, you're also taking them for others with whom you will share your experience with

5 details to begin thinking about and finalize over the next few weeks:

- When will you offer your event? (date/time)
- Where will you host it? (location)
- Who will you invite? (participants)
- What will you offer and how much will it cost to register? (length, price)
- How will participants pay you? (payment method)

Spending time thinking about these details is how you begin evisioning your event

Schedule it. Start telling people about it. Think about where you will host it (outdoor space? yoga/gym facility? your home?)

All of our actions begin as ideas. The clearer the idea, the easier it is to plan and manifest it into reality

Detailed event training is covered in weeks 8,9 and 10 to prepare you with everything you need to plan, prepare and confidently deliver a great event



9 ------- FEEDBACK

Foot nerd training is a constantly evolving framework and our team is focused on constantly improving the 12 week experience

Every person who works through training helps make it better by offering constructive feedback

We created a #feedback channel on slack and will check it weekly. We need your help to make foot nerd training better for future nerds

If at any point you have an idea about how we can improve the experience, please share your thoughts on Slack
