Welcome to week 1 of Foot Nerd Training

To keep in context on Slack, please add yourself to #week1 channel and engage 

Today marks your first day of spending 1 focused hour per day restoring healthy feet

Materials for week 1-6 are based on our HealthKit framework 

The content has been modified and expanded for Foot Nerds who go much deeper into the concepts than HealthKit members

----

In week 1 we cover: 

1) A dedicated hour
2) The golden rules
3) Proof of work
4) Screens
5) Pain



1 ------- A DEDICATED HOUR

Dedicating 60 focused minutes a day for 84 consecutive days may seem like a simple task, but in today's busy world, it can be very difficult

Human attention has become a commodity that companies spend billions of dollars fighting for, and so most of us 

In a chaotic distraction-centric world, focus is a superpower for those who can protect their energy and train their concentration

Focused attention is where deep work comes happens. It's where results are created. It's where insights are achieved

Focus is how we achieve in 1 hour what would typically take us several hours if distracted

Success requires courage, clarity and commitment

The courage to decide what is important, what you wish to spend your energy on, and to embark on a journey to achieve your objective by venturing into
the unknown

The clarity to form a plan and to protect ourselces from distraction so we can focus on achieving what we set out to do

A simple, clear commitment that we can use to hold ourselves accountable and keep on track

In order to clarify your commitment within Foot Nerd Training, answer these questions:

1) How do I define a dedicated hour? 
2) When will I complete my daily hour? How will I remind myself to do it? How will I track whether I'm succeeding or not?
3) How will I hold myself accountable? Who else can help support me along this journey?

If you lose your way and get off the path of completing your daily hour, do not be hard on yourself. Give yourself grace and simply begin again

This isn't a race, it's a process. Foot Nerds are here to support you and we are all doing this together


The daily hour will vary from day to day and from person to person. Here are examples of things you might fill that hour with:

- Reading github files
- Watching videos
- Planning out experiments
- Doing experiments
- Going for a walk barefoot or in natural footwear
- Training your balance
- Working to restore a resting squat position
- Connecting with other foot nerds on Slack
- Planning your workshop
- Having conversations about foot health with friends/family/coworkers

2 ------- THE GOLDEN RULES

5 simple yet powerful heuristics that offer clarity for the process

Simple doesn't mean easy, but simple keeps us accountable

The search for novelty through complexity distracts us

The golden rules for restoring healthy feet:

1) Wear natural footwear (for best results, work towards progressively eliminating unnatural footwear - cycle them out, go faster for faster results)
--> [and spend time barefoot]

2) Become capable of getting into a resting squat position for 2 minutes comfortably. If you can't, work towards it everyday until you can
3) Become capable of standing on 1 foot barefoot with your eyes closed for 60 seconds without making an error. If you cant, work on it until you can
4) Sit in chairs for 4 hours or less per day and if sitting in a chair, get up and move every 30 minutes
5) Adopt a long term mindset. It's not a race. A little bit better everyday is the objective. Be patient. Trust the process and show up everyday



3 ------- PROOF OF WORK

Proof of work is the tool we use to hold ourselves accountable

Taking notes everyday in our log is how we record data, but more importantly, those log entries serve as proof that we showed up and put in the work

Building a daily journalling habit can be tough

The challenge of not knowing what to write or even remembering to write can become obstacles to consistency

When making a commitment, having concrete ways to measure whether we're making good on our commitment is important for ensuring success

Writing everyday in your log is a clear and concrete way of proving that you showed up for yourself

The data you record serves as the raw ingredients for future analysis. Reviewing notes is when you detect patterns and determine whether you're making
progress or not. Whether your experiments are accomplishing what you intend them to accomplish.

Some days you might not write much. Sample entry:

[July 2 2022]
- Low energy today, busy day at work
- Watched the footwear video
- Purchased a pair of vivobarefoot shoes
- Spent 60 minutes on the floor watching netflix

Some days you might write a bit more. Sample entry:

[July 7 2022]
- Went for a 45 minute walk today in natural shoes without my phone
- My mind wandered towards work related things but I made an effort to focus on my breath and observing my surroundings
- Finished with 5 minutes barefoot on a variety of textures - cement, rocks, grass
- Did 5 minutes of balance work on my solemate, spent 30 seconds in a resting squat position and sat on the floor to take this note
- Tomorrow: Spend 20 minutes working on my squat position and improving ankle dorsiflexion

The focus isn't WHAT you write (over time it will get easier to record data that matters), it's THAT you wrote something. Showing up everyday is the goal

As Foot Nerds, our work is witnessed and reflected on by fellow Nerds on monthly calls. We post our completed data sheets on weeks 2,4, and 6

By being witnesses for others and having our work witnessed, we gain authority through our experience

Share your thoughts on proof of work (and samples of your pow log entries) in the #week1 channel on slack with other foot nerds



4 ------- SCREENS

Screens are how we measure progress. They are tools to help us monitor results being achieved by implementing the golden rules

They are how we determine whether we have found experiments that are truly enabling progress. They are how we determine truth and verify progress



Screens are an important feedback tool we can use to measure progress and objectively assess the results of our experiments

As Gray Cook says: "If we aren't measuring, we're guessing"

Gather baseline data on all screens and record results in your log

Compile your baseline screen data into your proof of work data sheet and submit it on weeks 2,4 and 6 for fellow Nerds to witness

Screens are an important feedback tool for measuring progress. They help us confirm/refute whether our experiments are yielding the results we're after

Nuggets:
- Be precise, be honest, help others screen themselves and get baseline measurements
- Re-test weekly and even after a training/experiment session

Task: based on your screens, create 3 concrete objectives/aspirations to achieve by the end of foot nerd training and plan out how you will get there

Example: 
I'm currently unable to achieve a resting squat position. By the end of foot nerd training, I will be able to rest comfortably in a squat for 60 seconds 
while breathing deeply and calmly. My plan to get there is to systematically address mobility at my ankles (measured w KTW) with 5 minutes of daily 
dorsiflexion mobilizations, to increase my hip mobility by spending 30 minutes a day sitting on the floor in a variety of positions, training my balance 
for 5 minutes everyday and doing 20 slow, controlled squats daily before my morning coffee (and pausing in the bottom position to take a deep breath)

I will screen my resting squat every 7 days to measure progress and take notes on how it feels and what I will focus on for the next 7 days



5 ------- PAIN

Pain is an imporant feedback signal that we must strive to learn from instead of ignoring

Pain is like a wise old man that teaches us lessons and guides us as we work to heal from an injury. Ignore the wise old man and we must repeat the lessons

Qualifying pain is important so we can look back on our data and detect patterns/trends. Detailed data = better results

Qualifiers: 
- location (where is it?)
- sharp or dull
- intermittent or constant
- intensity (0 to 10)
- movements/activities/positions that ease the pain
- movements/activities/positions that make the pain worse

Be curious about pain, don't fear it. Use it as a tool to better understand what is going on and whether things are progressing in the right direction
