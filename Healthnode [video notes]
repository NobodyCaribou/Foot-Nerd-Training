INTRO

Hello beautiful foot nerds. We hope your experience so far through foot nerd training was been rewarding and enjoyable

In week 11 we unpack the concept of what it means to be a community health leader. Something we call a Healthnode

Ruth and I are going to have an informal discussion today and talk about our answers to 5 questions:

1) What is a Healthnode?
2) Why does the world need more Healthnodes?
3) What does a Healthnode do?
4) How does a Healthnode make income?
5) How do we become effective Healthnodes for our communities

We hope you find the conversation interesting and we look forward to reading your thoughts in the #week11 slack channel or in a layer 2 conversation if
you want to connect with another foot nerd and discuss those 5 questions yourself


1 ------- WHAT IS A HEALTHNODE?

We encourage every foot nerd to craft their own definition of healthnode (interchangeable with community health leader)

If you haven't already, write your own definition down right now. 

It will change over time but its always nice to create a starting definition that we can look back on over time as we update our understanding

Ruth notes:
- a healthnode is the person in the community that you know will be able to point you in the right direction to find the person/resource you need
- a healthnode is a human who is a fantastic listener and knows who the people are in the community and seems to have the pulse on the neighborhood 
- maybe knowing the regularly scheduled activities about town that are healthy - examples: market days&times, live music, fun events like artwalks 
- a healthnode is someone who seems to being out and about and having a great time with others

Nick notes:
- Health: the process of learning how to take better care of myself and making daily changes
- A healthnode is someone who takes great care of themselves and leads with their actions
- They find meaning in helping others take better care of themselves by sharing their experiences and pointing to resources
- An individual who is known in the community and who creates opportunities for connection and conversations about health
- A community weaver that connects people


2 ------- WHY DOES THE WORLD NEED MORE HEALTHNODES?

Ruth notes:
- people are super hungry for something better in life that isn't centered around rigid discipline and "no pain, no gain" mentality. 
- the more humans we can help equip with the motto that "play is the way" and "fun is the point" and that "we're designed to feel good"
the better off our human family will be

Nick notes:
- Because the sick care system is being overwhelmed and we need more healthy people willing to help others restore health
- Because many people want to improve their health but few people understand how to take action
- To simplify health and offer clarity to those who are struggling



3 ------- WHAT DOES A HEALTHNODE DO?

Ruth notes:
- everything Nick said!
- and also a healthnode is always learning and creating opportunities for creating coherence


Nick notes:
- Take their health very seriously
- Asks great questions instead of offering answers
- Inspires action and empowers others by shares their experience and high quality resources that have helped them
- Organize gatherings and play sessions
- Engage regularly with their community and is skilled in the art of starting health conversations
- Connect with other nodes within the network for support and to collaboratively seek truth through dialogue


4 ------- HOW DOES A HEALTHNODE MAKE INCOME?

Ruth notes:
- the first thing is to shift the mindset that being a healthnode is equally as worth making a living as nurses, docs, PT's and other professionals
who are celebrated and highly paid for their work.
- this is one challenge that I see as significant. 
- working with the psychology and mindset about who is worthy to make the money

Nick notes:
- By delivering value to others
- By making it easy for people to pay them for the value they deliver

To earn income we must believe two things: 1) Our time is valuable, 2) Our understanding of health is valuable

If I price a 60 minute session at $125, I'm not just charging for 1 hr of my time. I'm charging for the 10 years of intense learning I've done to achieve
a deep experiential understanding of health. I'm charging for the clarity I offer the person by helping them understand what is truly important and what
is noise. 

Leading workshops, offering 1:1 help, coordinating play sessions, doing groceries with someone



5 ------- HOW DO WE BECOME EFFECTIVE HEALTHNODES FOR OUR COMMUNITIES?

Ruth notes:
- by showing up consistently to our work/play
- by consistently learning about our health and experimenting with our own health
- by consistently remembering that we don't have the answers or certainty about someone's health
- we cultivate the supple, flexible and shiftable mindset that embraces the idea that we're fostering independence and health sovereignty in others
not dependence.

Nick notes: 
- By starting with ourselves
- By taking responsibility for our health and gaining experience and understanding that we can then share with others
- By constantly improving our understanding of health
- By being motivated to continually invest energy into our own health process and creating opportunities to connect with others
- By connecting with other healthnodes to share challenges we face, stories of our work, insights we're having


6 ------- CLOSING
