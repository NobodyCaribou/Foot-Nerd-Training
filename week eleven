[DRAFT - work in progress]

Welcome to week 11 of Foot Nerd Training

Mention Guide training, opportunities to make an income

Post the March firside - learn about basecamp. Make money by selling basecamp tickets, be a resource to those people

Final POW call - event share/debrief




Now it's time to dive deeper into what it means to be a health leader in your community, something we call a Healthnode

This is the first version of this document and we hope that each foot nerd that completes training has a perspective to share

By openly sharing our ideas, engaging in productive discussion and offering input, we can improve and evolve our collective perspective of what it means to 
be a Healthnode (please share in the #week11 channel on Slack)

Becoming a community leader begins by leading yourself first

In order to help others improve their health, we must first take responsibility for our own

Mindfully engaging daily with the process of health is what gives us the stories and experience to share with others 


Week 11 tasks:
- Create opportunities to engage in health conversations within your local community
- Take notes and share inspiring stories with other nerds on Slack
- Craft your own definition of a Healthnode
- Set an aspiration for yourself to make a certain amount of income as a Healthnode over the next 12 months and write down detail of how you will do that
- Record a layer 2 conversation with another nerd to share thoughts, fears, and stories about becoming a Healthnode
--

Topics covered in week 11:


1. How do we make income?
2. How do we become Healthnodes?
3. Curating your own resource library



1 ------- HOW DO HEALTHNODES MAKE INCOME?

[mention TFC Guide product - free for all foot nerds, continuation of FNT, focus on helping nerds make income from helping others]

Guides are TFC affiliates: make money from explorer membership referrals, hardware sales, leading events, recruiting pros and guides for the community



Simply put: by providing value to their community 

There are many different ways to exchange value

Barter: trading goods and services and favours

Money: using a tool that stores our time to exchange value

V4V - allowing those you help to compensate you the amount they feel reflects the value they received from your help

Considerations: Deciding the value of your time. Deciding the value of your experience and understanding of health


In order to make money as a Healthnode, we must fundamentally believe two things: 

1) Our time and energy is valuable
2) Our understanding of health is valuable (confidence is a derivative of understanding)

How each healthnode translates the value they offer into income will vary with each individual and the local community they live within

It's really about creating valye for people people and making it easy for them to pay you for your help

What about liability?

My perspective is that if i'm not giving advice or telling people what to do, I don't have any liability for the actions they choose to take

Sharing my experience and pointing to great resources i've learned from is not the same as providing health advice or treatment

I'm just having human to human conversations and sharing my story

That said, i'm very careful with thinking about the questions people ask me and how I answer them

For example, if someone says they are having chest pain unexpectedly, I reply by saying: 

"that's out of my scope of understanding and you should see a doctor as soon as possible"

Everyone must do their own research but my sense if that if we are very clear with our language and actions and avoid offering advice, the concern over
liability is much lower

If you have a perspective to share, please do so in the #week11 channel on slack so we can add it to this document



6 ------- HOW DO WE BECOME HEALTHNODES?

When it comes to becoming a Healthnode, everyone must find their own path

We each form our own definition of Healthnode, have different aspirations, live in different communities and live different lives

Sharing stories and ideas of how we're individually working to become Healthnodes that serve our communities is how we inspire and learn from each other

If you want to contribute to this document, please send us stories and thoughts so we can add them for other nerds to read and learn from


--> Nick (Ottawa, Canada)

My definition of Healthnode is someone who takes excellent care of themselves and seeks to help others by sharing resources and stories

I currentlty live in Hintonburg, an urban neighborhood in Ottawa, Canada

My approach is simple: create as many opportunities as I can to connect with people in my local community

I do this by going on 2-3 walks per day (usually at least 1 barefoot walk) and making meaningful effort to connect with people

On walks I focus on being present (not listening to music/podcast or being on my phone), smiling at everyone, making eye contact, saying hi and never 
being in a rush

I ask people how their day is going, if they have any exciting plans on coming up or giving them an authentic compliment

I also ask people their name and make an effort to write down their name and something unique about them so I remember them next time I see them

As a curious person, I ask a lot of questions and make an effort to be fully present when I listen to what they have to say

If someone asks what I do for work I reply "I help people understand money & health" and this is often general enough that people are curious
to ask more questions. I talk about the pillars of health, why I switched from physical therapy to health and why my approach revolves around pointing
people to the right resources

One of my favourite questions to ask is: "How do you define health?". They key is to remain silent until they say something and not fill the silence with
speaking more. Let them think about what to say before chiming in (harder than you think at times)

I also organize gatherings. Example: sliding invitations under peoples doors in my condo building for a rooftop summer solstice gathering. I organized
games, facilitated introductions, cooked food to share, and curated a playlist by having people text me their favourite songs 

As a Healthnode, I seek truth daily in my own health research and connect with a global community to learn more than I can individually

I know my understanding of health is valuable and do my best to share that understanding with those ready to learn without telling them what to do

I lead with giving and am open to receive from those who get value from my help. Something I learned from Jeff Shub who is a foot nerd



7 ------- CURATING YOUR OWN RESOURCE LIBRARY

Part of becoming a foot nerd is curating a list of your favourite resources that can be shared with others

It's like a cheat sheet for health learning. A curated list of awesome resources that can be revisited personally or shared with others

The foot nerd library will serve as our master database as a community but each nerd should form their own personal library

Task: start your library by writing down your favourite resource (book, video, podcast, article) for each pillar of health and sharing it with other foot
nerds in the #week11 channel on slack
