Welcome to week 5 of Foot Nerd Training

We hope week 4 went smoothly and you recorded plenty of notes

To keep in context on Slack, please add yourself to #week5 channel and engage, share stories, seek help or learn from other foot nerds

Continue to update & review your data collection sheet in the shared google drive.

Reflection questions:
- Have you dedicated 1 uninterrupted hour to your Foot Nerd Training? If no, what are the obstacles keeping you from doing that?
- Have you been able to keep your experiments simple, focused and consistent? 
- What kind of differences are your seeing/feeling in your body as a result of your experimentation?

- Did I spend a daily hour restoring foot health for all 7 days? If not, why not?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?
- Did I check in with foot nerds on Slack?

Task: set a clear objective to accomplish in week 5 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

In week 5 we cover: 

1) Self regulation
2) Breath
3) Balance training

4) Pain



1 ------- SELF REGULATION

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjhPRwaJhvg

Reflection: What feedback do you use to self regulate? (ex: pain, soreness, fatigue, tendency to distract etc). Write concrete examples in your log

Becoming independent with our health requires us to self regulate. To know when to do more or less based on how we feel

Effective self regulation requires us to attune ourselves with signals from our body



2 ------- BREATH

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkjho3x2Z_8

Task: listen to James + Tom talk about breath and take notes

Practice: Go on several walks this week and focus your mind and body on your breath. Take notes (how did it feel? was it hard to focus?)



3 ------- BALANCE TRAINING

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mjm00oUUQaA

Task: listen to Mike + Nick talk about balance and take notes


Balance training is primarily a mental training tool. Like meditation, it trains our mind to focus on a single task: not falling over

Although primarily a focus training tool, balance work also has tremendous physical benefits for recalibrating the lower body

Time spent sitting in chairs creates imbalances around our hip joint and unplugs the important deep stabilizers that enable glute function

Relcaiming use of our glutes begins with plugging in those deep hip muscles and re-training our hips to act like hips again

Practice: Spend time this week mastering the movements below on your SoleMate 
(these beam projects were included in a previous version of the foot nerd project)

Share stories and progress videos with other nerds in the #week5 channel on slack


4 ------- PAIN

video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmthGnf2JpA

Pain is an imporant feedback signal that we must strive to learn from instead of ignoring

Pain is like a wise old man that teaches us lessons and guides us as we work to heal from an injury. Ignore the wise old man and we must repeat the lessons

Qualifying pain is important so we can look back on our data and detect patterns/trends. Detailed data = better results

Qualifiers: 
- location (where is it?)
- sharp or dull
- intermittent or constant
- intensity (0 to 10)
- movements/activities/positions that ease the pain
- movements/activities/positions that make the pain worse

Be curious about pain, don't fear it. Use it as a tool to better understand what is going on and whether things are progressing in the right direction
