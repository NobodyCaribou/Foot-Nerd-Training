Welcome to week 5 of Foot Nerd Training

We hope week 4 went smoothly and you recorded plenty of notes

To keep in context on Slack, please engage in the "#week5" channel to share stories, seek help or learn from other foot nerds

Reflection questions:

- Did I spend a daily hour restoring foot health for all 7 days? If not, why not?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?
- Did I check in with foot nerds on Slack?

Task: set a clear objective to accomplish in week 4 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

In week 5 we cover: 

1) Self regulation
2) Breath
3) Balance training


1 ------- SELF REGULATION

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjhPRwaJhvg

Reflection: What feedback do you use to self regulate? (ex: pain, soreness, fatigue, tendency to distract etc). Write concrete examples in your log

Becoming independent with our health requires us to self regulate. To know when to do more or less based on how we feel

Effective self regulation requires us to attune ourselves with signals from our body


2 ------- BREATH

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkjho3x2Z_8

Task: listen to James + Tom talk about breath and take notes

Practice: Go on several walks this week and focus your mind and body on your breath. Take notes (how did it feel? was it hard to focus?)


3 ------- BALANCE TRAINING

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mjm00oUUQaA

Task: listen to Mike + Nick talk about balance and take notes

Balance training is primarily a mental training tool. Like meditation, it trains your mind to focus on a single task: not falling over

Although primarily a focus training tool, balance work also has tremendous physical benefits for recalibrating the lower body

Time spent sitting in chairs can create muscular imbalances around our hip joint and unplug the important deep stabilizers that enable glute function

Relcaiming use of our glutes begins with plugging in those deep hip muscles and re-training our hips to act like hips again
