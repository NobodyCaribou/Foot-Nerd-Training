Welcome to week 1 of Foot Nerd Training

To keep in context on Slack, please engage in the "#week1" channel to share stories, seek help or learn from other Foot Nerds

Today marks your first day of spending 1 focused hour per day restoring excellent foot health. The flow is based on TFC's Foot & Ankle HealthKit and has
been modified for Foot Nerds who go deeper into the concepts than average people working through the HealthKit.

The daily hour will vary each day and form person to person. Here are examples of things you might fill that hour with:

- Reading github files
- Watching videos
- Planning out experiments
- Doing experiments
- Going for a walk barefoot or in natural footwear
- Training your balance
- Working to restore a resting squat position
- Connecting with other Foot Nerds on Slack

In week 1 we cover: 

1) Proof of work
2) Pain
3) Screens

1 ------- PROOF OF WORK

HealthKit video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr_gHXplV0A

Proof of work is included in foot nerd training as a tool we use to hold ourselves accountable

Taking notes everyday in our log is how we record data, but more importantly, those log entries serve as proof that we showed up and put in the work

Building a daily journalling habit can be tough. The challenges of not knowing what to writor even remembering to write can become obstacles to consistency

When making a commitment, having concrete ways to measure whether we're are making good on our commitment is important for ensuring success

Writing everyday in your log is a clear and concrete way of proving that you showed up for yourself

The data you record serves as the raw ingredients for future analysis. Reviewing notes is when you detect patterns and determine whether you're making
progress or not. Whether your experiments are accomplishing what you intend them to accomplish.

Some days you might not write much. Sample entry:

[July 2 2022]
- Low energy today, busy day at work
- Watched the footwear video
- Purchased a pair of vivobarefoot shoes
- Spent 60 minutes on the floor watching netflix

Some days you might write a bit more. Sample entry

[July 7 2022]
- Went for a 45 minute walk today in natural shoes without my phone
- My mind wandered towards work related things but I made an effort to focus on my breath and observing my surroundings
- Finished with 5 minutes barefoot on a variety of textures - cement, rocks, grass
- Did 5 minutes of balance work on my solemate, spent 30 seconds in a resting squat position and sat on the floor to take this note
- Tomorrow: Spend 20 minutes working on my squat position and improving ankle dorsiflexion

--

The focus isn't WHAT you write (over time it will get easier to record data that matters), it's THAT you wrote something. Showing up everyday is the goal.

Share your thoughts on proof of work (and samples of your pow log entries) in the #week1 channel on slack with other foot nerds

2 ------- PAIN

Pain is an imporant feedback signal that we must strive to learn from instead of ignoring

Pain is like a wise old man that guides you as you work to heal from an injury

Qualifying pain is important so we can look back on our data and detect patterns/trends. Detailed data = better results

Qualifiers: 
- location (where is it?)
- sharp or dull
- intermittent or constant
- intensity (0 to 10)
- movements/activities/positions that ease the pain
- movements/activities/positions that make the pain worse

Be curious about pain, don't fear it. use it as a tool to better understand what is going on and whether things are progressing in the right direction

3 ------- SCREENS

Introduction video:             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5VZo0xEHHA

Foot screen:                    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlZkH6WCJN8
Ankle screen:                   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VVDXAkQjUY
Squat screen:                   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUxLDIFZH6k

Gather baseline data on all screens and record results in your log

Screens are an important feedback tool for measuring progress and assessing results of our experiments


- If we aren't measuring, we're guessing
- Screens are a feedback tool that confirm/refute whether our experiments are productive or not

- Be precise, be honest, help others screen themselves and get baseline measurements
- Re-test weekly and even after a training/experiment session


Creating concrete objectives/aspirations to achieve by the end of foot nerd training and planning how you will get there

Example: 
I am currently unable to achieve a resting squat position. By the end of Foot Nerd training, I will be able to rest comfortably in a squat for 60 seconds 
while breathing deeply and calmly. My plan to get there is to systematically address mobility at my ankles (measured w KTW) with 5 minutes of daily 
dorsiflexion mobilization, to increase my hip mobility by spending 30 minutes a day sitting on the floor in a variety of positions, training my balance 
for 5 minutes everyday and doing 20 slow, controlled squats daily and pausing in the bottom position to take a deep breath. 

I will screen my resting squat every 7 days to measure progress and take notes on how it feels and what I will focus on for the next 7 days.
