FOOT NERD LIBRARY (master resource database)

Below is a collection of Foot Nerd learning resources categorized by pillar and by content type (shortest to longest)

[opportunity: organize library into an independent repo - Readme file contains links to each pillar, each pillar lists resources by content type and
sequenced from shortest and most basic to longest and most advanced]

Idea: database ID system. A code for each resource listed so they can be easily identified and searched
