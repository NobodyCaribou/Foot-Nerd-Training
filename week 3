Welcome to week 3 of Foot Nerd Training

We hope week 2 went smoothly and you recorded plenty of notes

To keep in context on Slack, please engage in the "#week3" channel to share stories, seek help or learn from other foot nerds

Reflection questions:

- Did I spend a daily hour restoring foot health for all 7 days? If not, why not?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?
- Did I check in with foot nerds on Slack?

Task: set a clear objective to accomplish in week 3 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

- beam work and barefoot (/natural footwear) walking - recalibration for the lower body and for the mind
- De-bugging the system
- Underestimated in how effective balance training and walking can be for restoring optimal movement/strength/coordination


5 ------- ACUTE INJURIES
