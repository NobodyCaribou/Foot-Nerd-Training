Welcome to week 3 of Foot Nerd Training

To keep in context on Slack, please add yourself to #week3 channel

We hope week 2 went smooth and you have been able to make good on your commitment to spend 1 focused hour everyday on your foot health
 
Complete these things everyday: 

1) Daily practice (12-30 min)
2) Take a note (5-10 min)
3) Study a concept and practice explaining it (5-10 min)

Tasks/dates this week:

-> On Feb 20 we have our second live pow orientation call at (time)

-> Be preprared to share golden nuggets from your first two weeks and to teach any of these concepts in 5 minutes or less: 
1) Daily pow log
2) Map to foot freedom
3) First principles
4) Inputs/Outputs

-> On Feb 21 (last day of week 3), set aside 30 minutes to review your notes from the past 6 days and extract a golden nugget

-> Set a clear objective to accomplish in week 3 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

----

In week 3 we cover: 

1) Natural foot function [core concept #5]
2) Natural footwear [core concept #6]
3) PCD
4) Less is more
5) Acute injuries
6) Setbacks
7) Play



1 ------- NATURAL FOOT FUNCTION

The health of our feet is a direct reflection of how we use them. The result of using our feet naturally is natural foot function

Natural foot function is the output created by exposing our feet to natural inputs

It describes feet that are strong, mobile, stable, resilient, and free of longstanding pain

Based on this definition, the quest to restore healthy feet is the quest to restore feet that function naturally


The opposite of natural foot function is foot dysfunction (unnatural foot function)

This describes feet that are weak, stiff, unstable, fragile and often painful

Foot dysfunction is the output created by exposing our feet to unnatural inputs over a prolonged period of time

--

What does it mean to use our feet naturally? What are natural inputs?

Our bodies are designed to move frequently, through a wide variety of movements, and without shoes

By exposing our feet to a wide variety of surfaces and a broad spectrum of loads and shapes, we maintain strength and mobility of our feet

When worn, footwear should protect our feet from damage without affecting our ability to load our muscles, move our joints, and feel the ground below us

There are limitless natural inputs that we can expose our feet to so it's often more helpful to mention unnatural inputs to avoid

By gradually eliminating unnatural inputs that negatively affect our foot health, we allow ourselves an opportunity to restore healthy feet

Like the quest for better health, the quest to restore natural foot function is a lifelong process, not a destination that we reach

What matters is not your current foot function, but the direction you're moving in

Are you moving towards natural foot function or toward foot dysfunction?

Unnatural inputs:
- Artificial support (from shoes or orthotics)
- Things that limit our joint mobility (stiff shoes, rigid inserts)
- Lack of movement variety (only stepping on flat/hard surfaces)
- Things that alter our perception of the ground below us (foam, air bubbles)
- Lack of loading (prolonged periods of sitting, arch support)
- Narrow shoes that compress our feet and squish our toes together
- Shoes with an elevated heel thal alter our posture and restrict full range of motion at the ankle

Examples of natural inputs:
- Barefoot walk on a variety of surface textures (grass, stones, pavement) and shapes (incline, decline, lateral tilts)
- Mobilizing our foot joints with a cork ball
- Balancing on a narrow, convex surface while wearing natural footwear



2 ------- NATURAL FOOTWEAR

Its seems like people wear footwear for two primary reasons: 1) Utility, 2) Fashion

The utility value of footwear is protection

Shoes are fundamentally specialized clothing we use to cover our feet in order to protect them from impact, puncture, abraision and temperature extremes

The fashion value of footwear is self expression. People wear shoes that make them look a certain way, often at the expense of their foot health

Everyone is free to wear the type of footwear they choose but many are not aware of the consequences or benefitds derived from their footwear choices

Armed with an understandinfg of how shoes affect our foot health and our movement quality, we become empowered to make better footwear decisions

--

All footwear exists on a continuum: at one end is natural footwear, at the other end is unnatural footwear

           
            Natural Footwear <--------------------------------------------------> Unnatural Footwear


Natural footwear: Footwear that allows natural foot function (allows feet to move like feet)

Unnatural footwear: Footwear that inhibits natural foot function (prevents feet from moving like feet)


--

How we use our feet is primarily determined by the environment

In the case of feet, the immeciate environment is the clothing we cover our feet with - aka the shoes we wear


It's quite simple really. Wear natural shoes and over time you restore healthy feet

Wear unnatural shoes and over time you develop foot dysfunction

In order to restore healthy feet, the goal is to gradually shift away from unnatural and towards natural

Reflection/practice:
- Shoe audit: would you consider the shoes you wear to be natural or unnatural?
- Explain and write how unnatural footwear causes bunions through SAID principle

Experiment: purchase a pair of natural shoes (www.thefootcollective.store) and make them your daily drivers

Take notes on how they feel and changes you sense are happening over time

3 ------- PROTECT, CORRECT, DEVELOP

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1edTmETmyw

Within the context of feet:
- Protect first by eliminating unnatural inputs
- Correct by restoring a baseline level of strength, mobility and stability at your feet with a consistent daily practice
- Develop resilience by progressively challenging your strength, endurance and stability. Constantly explore your limits 

Practice: 
- Explain foot health through the framework of PCD
- Specificaslly, explain why working to restore foot health while continuing to wear unnatural footwear limits our ability to improve



4 ------- LESS IS MORE

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ0zAXbNIYo

Potent examples of less is more:

- By subtracting "technology" from our footwear we optimize the technology of our feet (which is much more advanced than any shoe)
- By subtracting exercise machines and using simple tools (like a balance beam), we permit a much broader complexity of movement potential
- By simply standing on a balance beam, we recalibrate our lower body and our mind better than any complex exercise
- People underestimate the lower body recalibration potency of going for a walk in natural footwear

Practice: explain to a friend or family member why less tech in their shoes helps to restore natrual foot function 



5 ------- ACUTE INJURIES

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mr78lICHfk

Reflection: 
- Do you have any memorable experiences recovering from acute injuries?
- If you have anything to add or points you disagree with from the video, share them on slack



6 ------- SETBACKS

Over the course of your 12 week journey to become a foot nerd, you will face challenges

Things will not always go to plan, experiments won't always yield the results you desire and you may even feel like you're regressing at times

Setbacks are part of the process. In fact, setbacks are important. They are necessary for you to succeed on your mission to understand foot health

Setbacks re-orient us in the right direction when we stray off the path

In the words of Ryan Holliday - The obstacle is the way

I heard this quote once: "Emotions are hard to change. Perspective isn't"

It's hard to deal with negative emotions stemming from things we perceive to be failures

It's easy to view setback as lessons that must be taken in order for us to reach our goals

Harness the power of setbacks. Learn from them. Share those lessons with other nerds and people you help



7 ------ Play

"Play is the highest form of research" - Albert Einstein

Words of wisdom from one of the most brilliant scientists humanity has ever seen


Play is a powerful mindset when it comes to learning

Before reading on, answer this question: What is your definition of play?

Think of foot nerd training as a game. The rules are set but the way you play the game is up to you

Your daily hour can either be work-like drudgery or it can be the most fun, playful hour of your day

Play is a mindset. It's a way of viewing challenges that uses playful creativity to come up with solutions that are fun

If you feel like your daily hour has become a chore, inject more play. Keep it light, do experiments that you enjoy and make make you smile

Be creative. Invite friends to play with you. Add music. Make your daily experiments into a game

The only wrong way to complete foot nerd training is if you're not having fun

Want ideas on how to incorporate more play in your foot nerd training? Reach out to fellow nerds on slack in the #week3 channel

To inspire nerds that come after you to play more, share a nugget on slack about how you kept a playful mindset with your training
