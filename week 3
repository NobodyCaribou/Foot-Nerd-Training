Welcome to week 3 of foot nerd training

We hope week 2 went smoothly and you recorded plenty of notes

To keep in context on Slack, please engage in the "#week3" channel to share stories, seek help or learn from other foot nerds

Reflection questions:

- Did I spend a daily hour restoring foot health for all 7 days? If not, why not?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?
- Did I check in with foot nerds on Slack?

Task: set a clear objective to accomplish in week 3 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

----

In week 3 we cover: 

1) PCD
2) Data
3) 6 pillars
4) Less is more
5) Acute injuries



1 ------- PROTECT, CORRECT, DEVELOP

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1edTmETmyw

Practice: Explain foot health through the framework of PCD and why working to restore foot health while continuing to wear unnatural footwear doesn't work



2 ------- Data

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkd5r5ZpklQ

Practice: Collect 3 important data points right now



3 ------- 6 PILLARS

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECuwB2OKqoM

Practice: 
- Do the 6 pillars align with your current perspective of health? If yes, share why. If no, share why (on Slack)
- Explain the 6 pillars of health to a friend or family member



4 ------- LESS IS MORE

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ0zAXbNIYo

Potent examples of less is more:

- By subtracting "technology" from our footwear we optimize the technology of our feet (which is much more advanced than any shoe)
- By subtracting exercise machines and using simple tools (like a balance beam), we permit a much broader complexity of movement potential
- By simply standing on a balance beam, we recalibrate our lower body and our mind better than any complex exercise
- People underestimate the lower body recalibration potency of going for a walk in natural footwear

Practice: explain to a friend or family member why less tech in their shoes helps to restore natrual foot function 



5 ------- ACUTE INJURIES

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mr78lICHfk

Practice: 
- Do you have any memorable experiences recovering from acute injuries?
- If you have anything to add or points you disagree with from the video, share them on slack
