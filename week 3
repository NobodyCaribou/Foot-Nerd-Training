Welcome to week 3 of foot nerd training

We hope week 2 went smoothly and you recorded plenty of notes

To keep in context on Slack, please add yourself to #week3 channel to engage, share stories, seek help or learn from other foot nerds

Continue to update & review your data collection sheet in the shared google drive. Look at what other Foot Nerds are doing by browsing through

Reflection questions:
- Have you dedicated 1 uninterrupted hour to your Foot Nerd Training? If no, what are the obstacles keeping you from doing that?
- Have you been able to keep your experiments simple, focused and consistent? 
- What kind of differences are your seeing/feeling in your body as a result of your experimentation?

- Did I spend a daily hour restoring foot health for all 7 days? If not, why not?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?
- Did I check in with foot nerds on Slack?

Task: set a clear objective to accomplish in week 3 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

----

In week 3 we cover: 

1) PCD
2) Data
3) 6 pillars
4) Less is more
5) Acute injuries
6) Setbacks
7) Play



1 ------- PROTECT, CORRECT, DEVELOP

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1edTmETmyw

Practice: Explain foot health through the framework of PCD and why working to restore foot health while continuing to wear unnatural footwear doesn't work



2 ------- Data

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkd5r5ZpklQ

Practice: Collect 3 important data points right now



3 ------- 6 PILLARS

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECuwB2OKqoM

Practice: 
- Do the 6 pillars align with your current perspective of health? If yes, share why. If no, share why (on Slack)
- Explain the 6 pillars of health to a friend or family member



4 ------- LESS IS MORE

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ0zAXbNIYo

Potent examples of less is more:

- By subtracting "technology" from our footwear we optimize the technology of our feet (which is much more advanced than any shoe)
- By subtracting exercise machines and using simple tools (like a balance beam), we permit a much broader complexity of movement potential
- By simply standing on a balance beam, we recalibrate our lower body and our mind better than any complex exercise
- People underestimate the lower body recalibration potency of going for a walk in natural footwear

Practice: explain to a friend or family member why less tech in their shoes helps to restore natrual foot function 



5 ------- ACUTE INJURIES

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mr78lICHfk

Practice: 
- Do you have any memorable experiences recovering from acute injuries?
- If you have anything to add or points you disagree with from the video, share them on slack



6 ------- SETBACKS

Over the course of your 12 week journey to become a foot nerd, you will face challenges

Things will not always go to plan, experiments won't always yield the results you desire and you may even feel like you're regressing at times

Setbacks are part of the process. In fact, setbacks are important. They are necessary for you to succeed on your mission to understand foot health

Setbacks re-orient us in the right direction when we stray off the path

In the words of Ryan Holliday - The obstacle is the way

I heard this quote once: "Emotions are hard to change. Perspective isn't"

It's hard to deal with negative emotions stemming from things we perceive to be failures

It's easy to view setback as lessons that must be taken in order for us to reach our goals

Harness the power of setbacks. Learn from them. Share those lessons with other nerds and people you help



7 ------ Play

"Play is the highest form of research" - Albert Einstein

Words of wisdom from one of the most brilliant scientists humanity has ever seen



Play is a powerful mindset when it comes to learning

Before reading on, answer this question: What is your definition of play?

Think of foot nerd training as a game. The rules are set but the way you play the game is up to you

Your daily hour can either be world-like drudgery or it can be the most fun, playful hour of your day

Play is a mindset. It's a way of viewing challenges that uses playful creativity to come up with solutions that are fun

If you feel like your daily hour has become a chore, inject more play. Keep it light, do experiments that you enjoy and make make you smile

Be creative. Invite friends to play with you. Add music. Make your daily experiments into a game

The only wrong way to complete foot nerd training is if you're not having fun

Want ideas on how to incorporate more play in your foot nerd training? Reach out to fellow nerds on slack in the #week3 channel

To inspire nerds that come after you to play more, share a nugget on slack about how you kept a playful mindset with your training
