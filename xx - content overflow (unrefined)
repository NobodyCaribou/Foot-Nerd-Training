Dr A.J

My most recent interaction: connected with a doctor in the states struggling with foot problems. 

I told her I would give her an hour of my time on zoom and sent her questions ahead of time to think about and answer. 

I did little talking. Pointed to TFC resources. She paid me $250 usd worth of bitcoin (verify amount). 

I had zero expectations and was happy that I gave her $250 of value

Project: Crafting your content database

Every Foot Nerd should create their own resource database. We evolve them over time as we continue learning and we cross pollinate our databases

A collection of your favourite resources to learn from on topics related to health

Simple database 

48 resources

For each pillar of health: a "basic" and "advanced" piece of content in each media type

Pillars: Food, Movement, Mind, Community, Sleep, Money
Content types: Book, Video, Article, Podcast 

Curate a library of your best stuff that can be shared with others who are curious to learn

Everyone learns different (hence different content types), has different aspirations, and wishes to focus on different things. Be preprared when someone
asks you a question

30min conversation about being a healthnode (Ruth & Nick)

A Foot Nerd begins by helping others restore excellent foot health

- has a deep understanding of how to restore foot health

- Someone who leads by example

Who are the people in your community (local + digital)
How do you become known in the community?


- I go on a lot of walks and greet or speak to everyone I encounter
- Organize gatherings for people who live in the same building as me (solstice gathering: invites, food, games, music)
- Meet business owners, ask them their stories and why they do what they do
- Card with link to intro video of who you are, why you do what you do, what you offer
