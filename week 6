Welcome to week 6 of Foot Nerd Training

We hope week 5 went smoothly and you recorded plenty of notes

To keep in context on Slack,  please add yourself to #week6 channel and engage,share stories, seek help or learn from other foot nerds

Continue to update & review your data collection sheet in the shared google drive. 
Look at what other Foot Nerds are doing by browsing through the shared files here:

Reflection questions:
- Have you dedicated 1 uninterrupted hour to your Foot Nerd Training? If no, what are the obstacles keeping you from doing that?
- Have you been able to keep your experiments simple, focused and consistent? 
- What kind of differences are your seeing/feeling in your body as a result of your experimentation?

- Did I spend a daily hour restoring foot health for all 7 days? If not, why not?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?
- Did I check in with foot nerds on Slack?

Task: set a clear objective to accomplish in week 6 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

----

In week 6 we cover: 

1) Hardware + software [core concept #11]
2) 6 pillars [core concept #12]

1) Converting raw data into wisdom 
2) Focused objectives, re-screening
3) Understanding common pathologies


1 ------- Hardware & software


2 ------- 6 pillars

A useful framework for unpacking elements that combine into whole body health

A way to prioritize certain elements and a framework to understand the interrelated elements that combine to enable health


video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECuwB2OKqoM

Practice: 
- Do the 6 pillars align with your current perspective of health? If yes, share why. If no, share why (on Slack)
- Explain the 6 pillars of health to a friend or family member




3 ------- CONVERTING RAW DATA INTO WISDOM

The process of transforming raw data into wisdom is energy intensive

Creating system for reviewing notes and investing energy into processing observations into insights is an important element of learning

Our proof of work log serves as our repository of raw information that can then be reviewed in order to extract insights

- Raw data: a collection of facts in raw, unorganized form. Without context, data means very little
- Information: raw data that has been cleaned up and organized. Information is easier to analyze because it's more organized than raw data
- Knowledge: connecting pieces of information together. Knowledge enables us to understand and apply information towards a desired objective
- Wisdom: distilled knowledge than can be confidently applied in action. Principles and heurisitcs that are used as tools moving forward


Here's a powerful mental model I keep in mind:


          -   Wisdom    -
        ---  Knowledge  ---
      ----- Information -----
   --------  Raw Data   --------


As we move up the pyramid from bottom to top, we answer questions about and add value to the initial data

Each step requires time and energy devoted to thinking in order to detect patterns, connect dots and understand how things relate into a cohesive truth

The more we enrich our data with meaning and context, the more knowledge and insights we are able to extract

With insights and wisdom comes the ability to make better informed decisions

Step 1: Collect raw data everyday
Step 2: Summarize daily data into concise points
Step 3: Review chunks of data (7 days) and extract patterns
Step 4: Connect patterns together to build deeper understanding
Step 5: Compare our wisdom with that of others to further expand and refine fundamental truths

2 ------- FOCUSED OBJECTIVES, RE-SCREENING

Assessing results to determine experiments that worked best

Focus on a specific screen you want to improve and choose experiments this week with the goal of improving that screen

The more concrete the goals, the more likely you are to meet them

Practice: write out your thinking process including clear objectives and a plan to achieve them

Example: I want to focus on improving my squat position this week. My objective is to be able to spend 2 minutes in a resting squat position 

To get there I will explore my squat everyday this week, limit my time spent sitting in chairs and mobilize in the bottom squat position daily



3 ------- COMMON PATHOLOGIES

Part of being a foot nerd means understanding common pathologies and being able to explain them in simple, clear terms

What is the issue? What's the cause? How do we resolve it?

Here is a list of pathology explanations offered through the HealthKit:

- Overpronation                           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsgEWtgcOMI
- Hallux rigidus                          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlsTtL7z2Ao
- Athletes foot                           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPTvZ-wfulQ
- Bunions                                 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWFlARPBH9I
- Plantar fasciitis                       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuJ878i-oMM
- Shin splints                            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNV-qILVFnE
- Turf toe                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7988PV-UTsc
- Tib. post tendinosis/opathy             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4dikBFLb10
- Flat feet                               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w98_UH0PHmo
- High arches                             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQlbhwKrsYs

Practice: Watch the videos, understand the common issues and be able to explain them to a 10 year old

Challenge: Upgrade a pathology video by recording an explanation and submitting it in the feedback channel on slack so we can incorporate it
