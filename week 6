Welcome to week 6 of Foot Nerd Training

To keep in context on Slack, please add yourself to #week6 channel

We hope week 5 went smooth and you have been able to make good on your commitment to spend 1 focused hour everyday on your foot health
 
Complete these things everyday: 

1) Daily practice (12-30 min)
2) Take a note (5-10 min)
3) Study a concept and practice explaining it (5-10 min)

Tasks/dates this week:

-> On March 14 (last day of week 6), set aside 30 minutes to review your notes from the past 6 days and extract a golden nugget

-> Set a clear objective to accomplish in week 6 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

----

In week 6 we cover: 

1) Hardware + software [core concept #11]
2) 6 pillars [core concept #12]

3) Converting raw data into wisdom 
4) Understanding common pathologies


1 ------- Hardware & software

Many of us are familiar with the terms hardware and software in the context of the electronic devices that we use

Take your iphone for example: hardware is the physical phone, software is the set of instructions that tells the parts how to function

The same metaphor can be applied to humans: hardware is our physical body, software is how we use our bodies

As humans we're blessed with incredible hardware. It literally heals itself, organizes efficiently, and adapts to how we use it

Despite the magical hardware we inhabit, many people still develop hardware issues because they aren running poor software

Our mission at TFC is to empower people with truthful, useful, empowering information so they can take better care of themselves

In essence, we're trying to offer people a software update. The key to better health is better software and for humans, software is education

--

When we develop hardware issues with our bodies, we have two choices:

1) run better software that aligns with how our hardware was designed to be used
2) replace parts as they break

Unfortunately, modern medicine often chooses the second option

If my knee joint is wearing out because of poor movement patterns, medicine often opts to replace the joint instead of helping me update my software

Sitting for the majority of waking hours each day creates poor movement software

Reducing chair time, moving often and in a wide variety of shapes and spending time on the ground is a software upgrade

--

Having the right information is important but without spending energy applying that information in our lives, it becomes useless

Just like on our devices, running a software update takes time and energy

FNT is all about updating your software and learning how to effectively help others update their software

84 days of learning better information, spending time and energy applying that information and learning how to communicate it

By updating to better software, we protect and optimize our hardware

--

The collective compass is our flagship software at TFC that helps people reach basecamp

The software is constantly evolving and improving as more people use it and offer feedback on how we can make it better



2 ------- 6 pillars

As a health community focused on feet, itâ€™s important that we develop a well rounded understanding of holistic health

The six pillars is a mental model that expands the word health into the important components that contribute to overall health 

As guides who lead by example, we take our health seriously

We engage with the process of taking better care of ourselves everyday and we share our lessons with others

The six pillars is as an evolving mental model that we share as a community which helps us understand different elements we can focus on and optimize 

They are all bidirectionally interdependent, meaning each one of them affects each of the others in a two way relationship

It can be helpful to focus on a single pillar at any period of time in order to conserve energy and offer us clarity on the path forward



1: Mind
- Understand first principles
- Adopt a long term, mindset 
- Train our mind, prioritize daily solitude
- Understand and maintain optimal emotional health

2: Food
- Eat real food
- Listen to feedback from our body (mental state, energy levels, poop)
- Reduce snacking, experiment with fasting

3: Movement
- Move often and with variety
- Use it or lose it
- Avoid long periods of time in a single position
- Squat, hang, crawl, run

4: Sleep
- Prioritize restful sleep
- Caffeine + screen curfew, mindful alcohol consumption
- Listen to feedback (energy level in morning)

5: Community
- Spend time in nature
- Connect in person with other humans
- Develop and nourish meaningful relationships

6: Money
- Save using money that protects your time
- Reduce and eliminate debt
- Save a portion of your income for the future


A useful framework for unpacking elements that combine into whole body health

A way to prioritize certain elements and a framework to understand the interrelated elements that combine to enable health


video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECuwB2OKqoM

Practice: 
- Do the 6 pillars align with your current perspective of health? If yes, share why. If no, share why (on Slack)
- Explain the 6 pillars of health to a friend or family member



3 ------- CONVERTING RAW DATA INTO WISDOM

The process of transforming raw data into wisdom is energy intensive

Creating system for reviewing notes and investing energy into processing observations into insights is an important element of learning

Our proof of work log serves as our repository of raw information that can then be reviewed in order to extract insights

- Raw data: a collection of facts in raw, unorganized form. Without context, data means very little
- Information: raw data that has been cleaned up and organized. Information is easier to analyze because it's more organized than raw data
- Knowledge: connecting pieces of information together. Knowledge enables us to understand and apply information towards a desired objective
- Wisdom: distilled knowledge than can be confidently applied in action. Principles and heurisitcs that are used as tools moving forward


Here's a powerful mental model I keep in mind:


          -   Wisdom    -
        ---  Knowledge  ---
      ----- Information -----
   --------  Raw Data   --------


As we move up the pyramid from bottom to top, we answer questions about and add value to the initial data

Each step requires time and energy devoted to thinking in order to detect patterns, connect dots and understand how things relate into a cohesive truth

The more we enrich our data with meaning and context, the more knowledge and insights we are able to extract

With insights and wisdom comes the ability to make better informed decisions

Step 1: Collect raw data everyday
Step 2: Summarize daily data into concise points
Step 3: Review chunks of data (7 days) and extract patterns
Step 4: Connect patterns together to build deeper understanding
Step 5: Compare our wisdom with that of others to further expand and refine fundamental truths

4 ------- COMMON PATHOLOGIES

Part of being a foot nerd means understanding common pathologies and being able to explain them in simple, clear terms

What is the issue? What's the cause? How do we resolve it?

Here is a list of common pathology explanations:

- Overpronation                           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsgEWtgcOMI
- Hallux rigidus                          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlsTtL7z2Ao
