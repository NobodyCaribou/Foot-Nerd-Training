Old notes [from foot nerd experience]

-------> Ruth notes:
- are the lessons too long based on "tiny habits" -
- Liz had the feedback that if we are basing the experience on tiny habits to build on, the hour per day may be too much.
- 1 week of orientation on how to design your experience - choose the very most concise information to put in the orientation
- Maybe:  Put the pillars first: [Feet, Movement], [Sleep], [Food], [Mind], [Community], [Money]
- Because you cover science, SAIDS and many other lessons in the Feet sections, I'm wondering where we can cut redundancies in the other lessons? 
Like, do we need the hour long Science lesson when you cover becoming a scientist in the feet section? Could we cut that lesson all together?






-------> Nick notes:
- Every 7th week is a rest week
- After 1-2 weeks orientation, start with feet (do HealthKit in 3 weeks?)
- Screens from HK: major component of the FNE - accomplish great scores on all screens (pre-requisite to teaching healthkit experiences)
- Condense lesson schedule, make some lessons optional

- 28 wk structure. 7th week is a rest/catch up week

Questions:
- Is the current version too long? too intense? too detailed?
- Can we shorten the experience without eliminating important elements?
- Does the digital nature of the experience reduce motivation?
- What causes people to lose momentum or fall off track?

Input from nerds:
- Foot lesson should come earlier


2023 framework idea:
