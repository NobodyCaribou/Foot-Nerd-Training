Extra notes from week 4 lesson file

- Choose a hip experiment and do it everday for the next 7 days. Write notes and log data everyday

Experiment: half lotus                    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQtrEOym-zg
Quick screen: hacky rotations             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kHCqJP-k3o

Practice: Choose a training experiment for this week (mobility, strength, capacity)

Examples: 
- Train hip extension and rotation mobility everyday for 10 minutes
- Train squat strength by doing 3 sets of 10 loaded squats everyday this week

[10.10.22]

Extra notes from week 12 lesson file

- Write a brief plan about your next few months. Milestones you want to achieve, aspirations you want to work towards
- Celebrate your achievement
- Craft your foot nerd bio to be listed within our global directory of nerds once you have completed training

Debrief yourself. Send us feedback about what you liked and what we can improve within FNT. Submit resources to the library


- Synthesis: review (re-read) your notes, process the information (extract out the gems), summarize insights, integrate into your life and take notes on
the challenges with integration and ongoing thoughts about wisdom being applied

- Raw data -> secondary filter to keep 30% -> process and integrate the top 30% to yield 5% wisdom gems (heuristics) that you implement and share

Extra notes from orientation file

former POW details: 
- You are writing this for yourself. It's a cheat sheet that distills the most potent lessons learned over 12 weeks of training
- Your workshop plan/debrief serves as your own workshop guide to be evolved and improved over time
- Workshop plan: why are you giving a workshop? (purpose), when will you offer it? where will you host it? who will be invited? how will they pay?
- Workshop debrief: how did it go? what went well? what challenges did you face? what do you want to improve? when will you offer your next workshop?


5 ------- LAYER 2 CONVERSATIONS

Sharing stories and engaging in good faith disagreement is how we evolve our knowledge as a community

If you connect with another foot nerd and think others can benefit from your discussion, record it and we will make it available in the library

Ideas for layer 2 conversations:
- Sharing a story (your health story, a story about someone you're working with)
- Share a challenge you faced and how you overcame it
- Have a good faith disagreement about a specific topic
- Share your perspective on a topic or an insight you had related to foot health

**Layer 2 conversations will only be shared internally within the foot nerd community unless otherwise stated

Please send recordings to Ruth at nerdhelperteam@gmail.com



[9.20.22] - Week Eleven notes (overflow, extra raw material)

A Healthnode is someone who:

- Is known in the community as a person who understands health and coordinates fun things
- Organizes events, gatherings, games, play sessions. Invites people to join
- Seeks feedback from the community about struggles people are facing, needs not being met
- Spends time in community (around other people, animals, nature)
- Is open and available to help guide others by sharing their experience and pointing to good resources
- Asks great questions to understand where someone is at and what resource is right for them at the current moment
- Isn't afraid to say "I don't know" when asked a question they can't answer (and will research it/consult nerds with a specialty on the topic)


Healthnodes take care of their communities by:

- Offering their time to work 1:1 with individuals motivated to improve their health
- Coordinating gatherings
- Leading workshops, experiences and play sessions
- Creating content that inspires and educates
- Pointing people to the right tools & resources (by understanding where someone currently is on their health journey and where they want to get to)

Becoming known as someone in the community who:

1) Understands health and how to guide people towards it
2) Is open to and available to have conversations about health
3) Has access to a high quality database of resources that they can choose from and match to the right people


My approach: 
- be visible in the community 
- lots of walks, make eye contact, smile and say hi to everyone
- go barefoot a lot on walks, say hi, ask a lot of questions, be curious, write down and remember peoples names

[9.14.22] - Week ten notes (overflow, extra raw material)


Idea: part of FNT is offering an education experience. Small or large. To get your dogtag and be a true foot nerd, you must have given a workshop

Small: invite 3 friends over (bribe them with food) and give them a free session, collect feedback
medium: approach a gym/yoga studio and offer a 2 hour experience for 5-10 people
large: organize a half day workshop at a local gym/fitness facility, coordinate toolkits for everyone

FNT is a commitment to growing as a person. Growing your knowledge by restoring your foot health, making a commitment to spread the message in your
community and get paid to do that

**ordering equipment 
- Value exchange is mandatory. Barter if they want (make a nice meal for me) or monetary exchange (even if with friends and family) - why its important
- Elements that make up a high quality, pleasant, memorable, educational, fun experience
- Lessons from teachers (Ruth & Nick)
- What makes up a pleasant teaching experience?

- Planning your workshop: What (customize template), when (schedule it), for who (invite ppl), payment methods, how (preparation involved?)
- Walk through template: details from my perspective

2-4 hour in person experiences




Keys to organizing a great workshop

The responsibility of teaching

can be independently scheduled or promoted/scheduled/booked through TFC (20-50%)

-------

- Being adaptable in your delivery
- Confidence is the result of deep understanding
- Mastery mindset. Always seeking to improve content, always seeking feedback, always seeking to improve our delivery
- Deliver sticky golden nuggets (4f's, natural footwear, ground living), focus on the experience. Play is the way
- Excellence through preparation
- Lead by example: ability on screens
- Attention to details (punctuality, timechecks, caring for the hosting facility)


Rituals:
- re-writing my notes the afternoon before the session (90min)
- debrief (what was good? what can be improved? what challenged me? did I have fun?)

[8.22.22]

Define what health means to you. This is your lighthouse

Regularly re-orient yourself to that lighthouse and re-evaluate your definition of health as you learn

Take action. Get started. Make small, consistent changes. They add up very quick

Focus on the process, not the outcome

Old notes [from foot nerd experience]

-------> Ruth notes:
- are the lessons too long based on "tiny habits" -
- Liz had the feedback that if we are basing the experience on tiny habits to build on, the hour per day may be too much.
- 1 week of orientation on how to design your experience - choose the very most concise information to put in the orientation
- Maybe:  Put the pillars first: [Feet, Movement], [Sleep], [Food], [Mind], [Community], [Money]
- Because you cover science, SAIDS and many other lessons in the Feet sections, I'm wondering where we can cut redundancies in the other lessons? 
Like, do we need the hour long Science lesson when you cover becoming a scientist in the feet section? Could we cut that lesson all together?






-------> Nick notes:
- Every 7th week is a rest week
- After 1-2 weeks orientation, start with feet (do HealthKit in 3 weeks?)
- Screens from HK: major component of the FNE - accomplish great scores on all screens (pre-requisite to teaching healthkit experiences)
- Condense lesson schedule, make some lessons optional

- 28 wk structure. 7th week is a rest/catch up week

----
----

Questions:
- Is the current version too long? too intense? too detailed?
- Can we shorten the experience without eliminating important elements?
- Does the digital nature of the experience reduce motivation?
- What causes people to lose momentum or fall off track?

Input from nerds:
- Foot lesson should come earlier


2023 framework idea:
