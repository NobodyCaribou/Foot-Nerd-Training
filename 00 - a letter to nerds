Hello foot nerd family

I love you all and hope you are keeping well by taking excellent care of yourselves.

I'm sending this letter because it seems to me that we have a storm approaching and we will be making changes to adapt accordingly.

As the world changes, so too must our trajectory as a community of health leaders and as a company.

The current times have created a sense of urgency to shift our focus with the Foot Nerd project. 

Unprecedented times will test our collective resilience as humans and my hope is that it will help people focus on what matters: health.

Theese times will not last forever and the beautiful world that lies on the otherside will be well worth the sacrifices we've made to get there.

To conserve our energy, the foot nerd project will focus our resources on a clear and important mission: 

Expand the foot nerd community and update our training to help foot nerds to become health leaders within their local communities. 

We feel the current 360 day offering is a powerful tool of transformation for those who a ready to make a major commitment to health but have also found
the interest to be much lower than expected.

It's a long journey, it's difficult, and in todays chaotic world, many are finding it hard to stay the course and keep on track. 

Our aspiration is to train as many foot nerds as possible within the next 12 months to expand our collective impact. 

We want to empower nerds to develop the ability and confidence required to become powerful healthnodes within their local communities.

Earning an income by teaching workshops and being a resource to help others restore health is an essential element for sustainability. 

This will be a major focus of foot nerd training.

Foot Nerd Training is a 12 week commitment of 1 hour per day based on the following framework:

- Orientation (1 week)
- Foot restoration (6 weeks)
- Note review/peer discussion (1 week) 
- Workshop training (3 weeks)
- Healthnode training (1 week)
- Debrief + POW submission (1 week)

By the end of foot nerd training, individuals will have significantly improved their foot heath, gained a foundational understanding of the process of 
restoring foot health (a better understanding than I received during a 2 year masters of physical therapy), earned an income teaching a workshop in their 
local community, and be on a path earn an income by helping individuals seeking to restore excellent foot health.

Foot nerd training is a return to our roots. Doing what we do best: helping people restore excellent foot health and forging health leaders

All content within the 360 day commitment will continue to be available to Nerds and we are considering offering the longer journey again in future if the
opportunity presents itself.

It's been an honour to learn alongside you all and I'm excited to continue the foot nerd project with a renewed focus so we can grow our numbers and expand
our positive impact on health culture around the world, starting with feet.

This is a powerful community. Letâ€™s use that collective power to support and empower others to reclaim responsibilty for their health

Love you all

Nick
