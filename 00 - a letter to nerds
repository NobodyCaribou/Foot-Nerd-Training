Hello foot nerd family

I hope you are all keeping well by taking excellent care of yourselves.

I'm sending this letter because it seems we have a storm approaching that we must prepare for and adapt accordingly.

As the world changes, so too must our trajectory as a community of health leaders and as a company.

Unprecendented times have created a sense of urgency to shift our focus with the Foot Nerd project. 

The next 12-24 months will test our collective resilience as humans and my hope is that it will nudge people to focus on what matters: health.

The good news: Challenging events to come will help us grow and create a more beautiful world for us all to enjoy.

To conserve our energy, the foot nerd project will focus our resources on a clear objective: 

Expand the foot nerd community and update our training to help individuals become health leaders within their local communities. 

We feel the current 360 day offering is a powerful tool of personal transformation for those who a ready to make a major commitment to health but have
found the interest to be lower than expected and must adapt to make better use of resources.

It's a long journey, it's difficult, and in todays chaotic world, many are finding it hard to stay the course and keep on track. 

Our renewed aspiration is to train as many foot nerds as possible within the next 12 months to scale our positive impact as a community of leaders.

We plan to bring back events in a big way for 2023 to do our part in helping people reconnect with themselves and each other after two long years apart.

Earning income helping others is a key element for nerds to find meaningful, sustainable work. Because of this, we will focus heavily on workshop and 
Healthnode training for our updated offering. 

Foot Nerd Training is a 12 week commitment of 1 hour per day based on the following framework:

- Orientation (1 week)
- Experientially restore excellent foot health (6 weeks)
- Note review/peer discussion (1 week) 
- Workshop training (3 weeks)
- Healthnode training (1 week)
- Debrief + POW submission (1 week)

During foot nerd training, individuals will:

1) Restore healthy feet, and by doing so, gain a robust understanding of the process of restoring foot health 
(a better understanding than I received during a 2 year masters of physical therapy)

2) Earn income teaching a workshop in their local community

3) Be on a path to sustainably earn an income by helping individuals seeking to restore excellent foot health


Foot nerd training is a return to our roots. Doing what we do best: helping people restore healthy feet and inspiring people to become health leaders in
their local communities

All content from the 360 day commitment will continue to be available to nerds and we are considering offering the longer journey again in future if the
opportunity presents itself.

2023 will be a big year. Some exciting things we have planned:

- Opening our first community center pilot location in Australia. This will be a template we hope to apply to other major cities around the world and will
serve as health hubs stewarded by foot nerds

- Nerd meetups in USA and Europe

- 1 week intensive in person Foot Nerd Training Experience (likely in Europe)

These plans are all preliminary right now and there's still lots of work to be done. That said, in order to get somewhere, you need to know where you want 
to go and put together a plan to get there so we're getting to work and will keep everyone updated as things progress. 

It's been an honour to learn alongside you all and I'm excited to continue the foot nerd project with a renewed focus so we can grow our numbers and expand
our positive impact on health culture around the world, starting with feet.

Our updated mission at TFC is to help 250 million people restore healthy feet. Thank you for being an important part of that mission.

I'm grateful to know and learn from each of you and hope your experience as a foot nerd has helped you improve your health and grow as a person. 

Love you all

Nick
