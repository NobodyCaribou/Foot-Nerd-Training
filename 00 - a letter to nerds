Hello foot nerd family

I love you all and hope you are keeping well by taking excellent care of yourselves.

I'm sending this letter because it seems to me that we have a storm approaching and we will be making changes to adapt accordingly.

As the world changes, so too must our trajectory as a community of health leaders and as a company.

Unprecendented times have created a sense of urgency to shift our focus with the Foot Nerd project. 

The next 12-24 months will test our collective resilience as humans and my hope is that it will nudge people to focus on what matters: health.

The good news? Challenging events to come will help us grow and create a more beautiful world for us all to enjoy.

To conserve our energy, the foot nerd project will focus our resources on a clear objective: 

Expand the foot nerd community and update our training to better help individuals become health leaders within their local communities. 

We feel the current 360 day offering is a powerful tool of transformation for those who a ready to make a major commitment to health.

That said, we've found the interest to be much lower than expected and must adapt to make better use of resources.

It's a long journey, it's difficult, and in todays chaotic world, many are finding it hard to stay the course and keep on track. 

Our aspiration is to train as many foot nerds as possible within the next 12 months to expand our collective impact. 

Earning income helping others is a key element for nerds to find meaningful, sustainable work. 

Because of this, we will focus heavily on workshop and healthnode training for our updated offering. 

Foot Nerd Training is a 12 week commitment of 1 hour per day based on the following framework:

- Orientation (1 week)
- Experientially restore excellent foot health (6 weeks)
- Note review/peer discussion (1 week) 
- Workshop training (3 weeks)
- Healthnode training (1 week)
- Debrief + POW submission (1 week)

By the end of foot nerd training, individuals will:

1) Restore their foot health

2) Gain a robust understanding of the process of restoring foot health 
(a better understanding than I received during a 2 year masters of physical therapy)

3) Earn income teaching a workshop in their local community, 

4) Be on a path to sustainably earn an income by helping individuals seeking to restore excellent foot health

Foot nerd training is a return to our roots. Doing what we do best: helping people restore excellent foot health and forging health leaders

All content within the 360 day commitment will continue to be available to Nerds and we are considering offering the longer journey again in future if the
opportunity presents itself.

It's been an honour to learn alongside you all and I'm excited to continue the foot nerd project with a renewed focus so we can grow our numbers and expand
our positive impact on health culture around the world, starting with feet.

This is a powerful community and it gives me great joy to know you all and learn from you.

Love you all

Nick
