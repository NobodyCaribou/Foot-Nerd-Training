Reflection questions:
- Have I dedicated 1 uninterrupted hour to your Foot Nerd Training? If no, what are the obstacles keeping me from doing that?
- Have I been consistent with my daily practice? If not, why not? 
- What differences am I seeing/feeling in my body?


----

Week 7 focus: 
- Explore community
- Connect with peers
- Share stories
- Plan your event
- Recharge
- Prepare for the last 5 weeks of training


We cover:

1) Community
2) Extracting insights
3) Reflection
4) Sharing insights and learning from others
5) Dialogue



1 ------- COMMUNITY

Joining Kajabi, exploring the space, engaging with the community, connecting with fellow nerds in the Foot Nerd circle

Ask Ruth if you need help (guides@thefootcollective.com)



2 ------- EXTRACTING INSIGHTS

An insight is a deep understanding of something

Insights are the output of time spent processing data in search of patterns/correlations in order to achieve deeper conclusions

The energy we spend processing raw data is like the energy we spend when assembling a puzzle

The more effort we expend to assemble the individual pieces (raw data), the better clarity we get of the final image (insights)

Here are some examples of insights I've had on my personal foot health journey:

- Training my balance reduces calf an low back muscle tension
- Wearing natural footwear is the most important element in restoring healthy feet
- Bunions can be reversed by eliminating compressive footwear and using toe spreaders consistently

Share your insights with fellow nerds and our global commununity


3 ------- REFLECTION

Some self reflection questions to ask yourself this week:

What are my most profound lessons so far?

My most memorable aha moments? 

Things from FNT that I disagree with or have an alternate perspective to offer?

What changes have I observed/felt in my body? 

What challenges did I face?

What area of my body did I realize needs work? 

What experiments did I find most enjoyable? Most powerful?

What blind spots in my awareness did I uncover?



4 ------- SHARING INSIGHTS AND LEARNING FROM OTHERS

Sharing what we learn individually is how we upgrade our collective understanding as a community

Our learning capacity as a group is much higher when we engage with one another and share our lessons

Comparing insights, engaging in productive disagreement, and learning from the experience of fellow nerds is an important component of foot nerd training

Ways to share insights:
- Discussions on slack
- Connecting with other nerds on a zoom call
- Share a detailed story with other foot nerds within our community forum

Practice: 
- Write out the 2 most powerful lessons you learned over the past 6 weeks (1 sentence each) and share them with other foot nerds
- Share your top 3 most powerful experiments.



5 ------- DIALOGUE

Part of your foot nerd journey is engaging in dialogue with other nerds

Whether it's sharing the brand of shoes you're using and why you like them or seeking support for an obstacle you're facing, slack is a place to connect
with humans from around the world who want to nerd out on foot health

Examples of things to share/discuss with each other:

- How did you make the process fun? How did you remind yourself daily to show up and do the work?
- How can the lesson content be improved?
- How frequently did you screen yourself for changes?
- Who do you plan to teach what you have learned? (who, when, how)
- What are your favourite natural footwear brands?
- What foot health milestones are you setting for yourself to continue working on?
- What was your most memorable barefoot experience?
- What objections do people have when you tell them about going barefoot, switching to natural shoes or reducing time spent sitting in chairs?
