Reflection questions:
- Have I dedicated 1 uninterrupted hour to your Foot Nerd Training? If no, what are the obstacles keeping me from doing that?
- Have I been consistent with my daily practice? If not, why not? 
- What differences am I seeing/feeling in my body?

Week 7 focus:

- Connect with peers
- Share stories
- Plan your event
- Recharge
- Prepare for the last 5 weeks of training


We cover:

1) Community
2) Extracting insights
3) Reflection
4) Sharing insights and learning from others
5) Dialogue
6) Planning your event



1 ------- COMMUNITY

Our primary focus at TFC for 2023 is community

We want to create high quality opportunities for members of our global network to connect both digitally and in person

In order to bring everyone together, we launched a new digital platform on Feb 1, 2023 that enables us the foster community and coordinate events

Week 7 is a time to integrate what you learned in the past 6 weeks and to share your nuggets with peers

We've created a private foot nerd forum within our new digital home as a place for nerds to connect, share and discuss topics

To join the new space, visit www.thefootcollective.com and select "join the community"

Once in the platform, send a message to Nick or Ruth and we can welcome you to the foot nerd forum

Check out the fireside chat, explore the challenges, earn some proof of work reward points (powr points) and connect with members

If you have any issues accessing the new platform, email Ruth at guides@thefootcollective.com and she can help you out



2 ------- EXTRACTING INSIGHTS

An insight is a deep understanding of something

Insights are the output of time spent processing data in search of patterns/correlations in order to achieve deeper conclusions

The energy we spend processing raw data is like the energy we spend when assembling a puzzle

The more effort we expend to assemble the individual pieces (raw data), the better clarity we get of the final image (insights)

Here are some examples of insights I've had on my personal foot health journey:

- Training my balance reduces calf an low back muscle tension
- Wearing natural footwear is the most important element in restoring healthy feet
- Bunions can be reversed by eliminating compressive footwear and using toe spreaders consistently

Share your insights with fellow nerds and our global commununity


3 ------- REFLECTION

Some self reflection questions to ask yourself this week:

What have been my most profound lessons so far?

My most memorable moments? 

Things from FNT that I disagree with or have an alternate perspective to offer?

What changes have I observed/felt in my body? 

What challenges did I face?

What area of my body did I realize needs work? 

What experiments did I find most enjoyable? Most powerful?

What blind spots in my awareness did I uncover?



4 ------- SHARING INSIGHTS AND LEARNING FROM OTHERS

Sharing what we learn individually is how we upgrade our collective understanding as a community

Our learning capacity as a group is much higher when we engage with one another and share our lessons

Comparing insights, engaging in productive disagreement, and learning from the experience of fellow nerds is an important component of foot nerd training

Ways to share insights:
- Discussions in the foot nerd forum
- Connecting with other nerds on a zoom call
- Sharing a detailed story with other foot nerds within our community forum
- Sharing an experience on a live community fireside call



5 ------- DIALOGUE

Part of your foot nerd journey is engaging in dialogue with other nerds

Whether it's sharing a story or seeking support for an obstacle you're facing, the nerd forum is the place to connect with the nerd herd

Examples of things to share/discuss with each other:

- Your favourite natural footwear brands and why you like them
- Fears around leading your event
- How you make your learning process fun
- How you remind yourself daily to show up and do the work
- Suggestions on how lesson content can be improved
- How frequently you screened yourself for changes
- The people you want to share your new understanding with
- Foot health milestones are you setting for yourself to continue working on
- Your most memorable barefoot experience?
- Objections people have when you tell them about going barefoot, switching to natural shoes or reducing time spent sitting in chairs



6 ------- PLANNING YOUR EVENT

Your event is 3 weeks away. Week 7 is a good opportunity to finalize the concepts you want to teach and the type of session you want to lead

I you haven't already, finalize details about your event (when/where/what) and begin telling people about it

Get confirmations from people who want to attend and take down their email/phone numbers so you can send them reminders/updates leading up to the date

Get excited about your session. Know that you have acquired a deep understanding of foot health through experience and have value to offer

75% of shoe wearing people face foot issues at some point in their lives and half of those people must modify their activities because of the problem

Know that you can be the person who helps them avoid those issue. Who empowers them with important information about how to care for themselves

Deeply understanding how impactful the information you possess can be to others reinforces your sense of purpose and meaning in teaching

If you need support, head to the foot nerd forum and connect with other nerds who have experience teaching and can share their experience
