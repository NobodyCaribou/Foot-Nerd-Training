[Work in progress. Completion deadline: 8.21.22]

Welcome to week 7 of Foot Nerd Training

We hope week 6 went smoothly and you recorded plenty of notes

To keep in context on Slack, please engage in the "#week7" channel to share stories, seek help or learn from other foot nerds

Reflection questions:

- Did I spend a daily hour restoring foot health for all 7 days? If not, why not?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?
- Did I check in with foot nerds on Slack?

Task: set a clear objective to accomplish in week 7 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

----

Week 7 is focused on note review of your first 6 weeks and peer discussions to share stories and perspectives

We cover:

1) Reviewing notes
2) Extracting insights
3) POW summary for weeks 1-6
4) Sharing insights and learning from others


1 ------- REVIEWING NOTES

2 ------- EXTRACTING INSIGHTS

3 ------- POW SUMMARY FOR WEEKS 1-6
