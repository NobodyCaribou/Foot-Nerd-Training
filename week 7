Welcome to week 7 of foot nerd training

We hope your 6 weeks of restoring healthy feet has been a productive, enjoyable and interesting journey

By now you should have plenty of raw data in your log. Week 7 is all about processing that data and connecting with peers to share experiences

To keep in context on Slack, please engage in the "#week7" channel to share stories, seek help or learn from other foot nerds

Reflection questions:

- Did I spend a daily hour restoring foot health for all 7 days? If not, why not?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?
- Did I check in with foot nerds on Slack?

Task: set a clear objective to accomplish in week 7 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

----

Week 7 is a chance to connect with peers, share stories, review & summarize your daily notes, recharge, and prepare for the last 5 weeks of training


We cover:

1) Reviewing notes
2) Extracting insights
3) POW summary for weeks 1-6
4) Sharing insights and learning from others
5) Dialogue



1 ------- REVIEWING NOTES

Creating a system for reviewing your notes will help you make the most of this week

Spend your first day this week planning out your system. Here is week 7 sample plan outlining a system for reviewing notes:

Weekly plan: 
- Day 1: Design a plan for the week, go for a walk
- Day 2-6: review daily notes, summarize each day into 1-2 bullet points, go for a walk, go on slack 
- Day 7: condense all bullet points into 1 page, note most powerful lessons, challenges and insights

Day 2,3,4,5,6 daily plan
- Read notes, summarize into 1-2 bullet points                                      20 min 
- Go on a walk and think about the most important nuggets from notes                15 min
- Write down insights from walk                                                     5 min 
- Go on slack, share my insights and read what other nerds are sharing              20 min



2 ------- EXTRACTING INSIGHTS

An insight is a deep understanding of something

Insights are the output of time spent processing data in search of patterns/correlations in order to achieve deeper conclusions

The energy we spend processing raw data is like the energy we spend when assembling a puzzle

The more effort we expend to assemble the individual pieces (raw data), the better clarity we get of the final image (insights)

Here are some examples of insights I've had on my personal foot health journey:

- Training my balance reduces calf an low back muscle tension
- Wearing natural footwear is the most important element in restoring healthy feet
- Bunions can be reversed by eliminating compressive footwear and using toe spreaders consistently



3 ------- POW SUMMARY FOR WEEKS 1-6

In week 7 you will draft a 1 page summary of what you learned in weeks 1-6

This helps crystallize your 6 week learning journey and is the first page of your 3 page POW submission to complete foot nerd training

Examples of things to include:

What were your most profound lessons? Your most memorable aha moments? Content from training that you disagree with?

What changes did you observe in your body? What challenges did you face?

What area of your body did you realize needs work? 

What experiments did you find most enjoyable? Most powerful?

What blind spots in your awareness did you uncover?



4 ------- SHARING INSIGHTS AND LEARNING FROM OTHERS

Sharing what we learn individually is how we upgrade our collective understanding as a community

Our learning capacity as a group is much higher when we engage with one another and share our lessons

Comparing insights, engaging in productive disagreement, and learning from the experience of fellow nerds is an important component of foot nerd training

Ways to share insights:
- Discussions on slack
- Connecting with other nerds on a zoom call (when appropriate, record and submit as a L2 conversation for other nerds to learn from)
- Write a formal story about one of your experiences and share it as a PDF in slack

Practice: 
- Write out the 2 most powerful lessons you learned over the past 6 weeks (1 sentence each) and share them with other foot nerds on Slack
- Share your top 3 most powerful experiments in slack. Your input will help us rank order experiments by power


CHALLENGE (for those interested in helping to upgrade FNT)

Pick a current experiment video, refilm it yourself and post it to the #week7 channel in slack

OR

Create and submit a new experiment to our shared experiment database in github



5 ------- DIALOGUE

Part of your foot nerd journey is engaging in dialogue with other nerds

Whether it's sharing the brand of shoes you're using and why you like them or seeking support for an obstacle you're facing, slack is a place to connect
with humans from around the world who want to nerd out on foot health

Examples of things to share/discuss with each other:

- How did you make the process fun? How did you remind yourself daily to show up and do the work?
- How can the lesson content be improved?
- How frequently did you screen yourself for changes?
- Who do you plan to teach what you have learned? (who, when, how)
- What are your favourite natural footwear brands?
- What foot health milestones are you setting for yourself to continue working on?
- What was your most memorable barefoot experience?
- What objections do people have when you tell them about going barefoot, switching to natural shoes or reducing time spent sitting in chairs?
