[Work in progress. Completion deadline: 8.21.22]

Welcome to week 7 of Foot Nerd Training

We hope week 6 went smoothly and you recorded plenty of notes

To keep in context on Slack, please engage in the "#week7" channel to share stories, seek help or learn from other foot nerds

Reflection questions:

- Did I spend a daily hour restoring foot health for all 7 days? If not, why not?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?
- Did I check in with foot nerds on Slack?

Task: set a clear objective to accomplish in week 7 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

----

Week 7 focus:
- Reviewing and processing notes from your first 6 weeks
- Engaging in peer discussions to share stories and perspectives

We cover:

1) Reviewing notes
2) Extracting insights
3) POW summary for weeks 1-6
4) Sharing insights and learning from others


1 ------- REVIEWING NOTES

Creating a system for reviewing you notes helps to make the most of this week

Sample daily template for week 7: 

- Pick a week, read your notes, summarize each day into 1-2 bullet points           20 min 
- Go on a walk and think about the most important nuggets from those 7 days         15 min
- Note insights from your walk                                                      5 min 
- Go on slack, share your nuggets and read what other nerds are sharing             20 min



2 ------- EXTRACTING INSIGHTS

An insight is a deep understanding of something

Insights are the output of time spend processing data in search of patterns and correlations in order to achieve deeper conclusions



3 ------- POW SUMMARY FOR WEEKS 1-6

The component of your POW submission to complete foot nerd training is a 1 page summary of what you learned in weeks 1-6

What were your most profound lessons? Your most memorable aha moments? Content from training that you disagree with?

What changes did you observe in your body? What challenges did you face?

What area of your body did you realize needs work? 

What experiments did you find most enjoyable? Most powerful?



4 ------- SHARING INSIGHTS AND LEARNING FROM OTHERS

Sharing what we learn individually is how we upgrade our collective understanding as a community

As a group we have a much higher learning capacity when we combine our lessons

Comparing insights, engaging in productive disagreement, and learning from the experience of fellow nerds is an important component of foot nerd training

Ways to share insights:
- Discussions on slack
- Connecting with other nerds on a zoom call (record and submit it as a L2 conversation for other nerds to learn from)
- Write a formal story about one of your experiences and share it as a PDF in slack

Practice: Write out the 3 most powerful lessons you learned over the past 6 weeks (1 sentence each) and share them with other foot nerds on Slack

--> RAW

Practice:
- Share your top 3 most powerful experiments on slack in the #week7 channel on slack. Your input helps us rank order experiments by power

Extra challenge: upgrade a current experiment video (refilm it), create and submit a new experiment (post the video #week 7 channel on slack)

Defrief from weeks 1-6, draft your 1 page summary (POW component)
- Review and filter notes
- Share stories (L2 conversations) with other Foot Nerds within #week7 channel on Slack

- Connect with your peers over slack or zoom to share your 6 week foot restoration journey
- This is a chance to connect with peers, share stories, review & summarize your daily notes, recharge, and prepare for the last 4 weeks of training

- Share your insights, challenges, victories, favourite experiments, favourite lesson, things you would add to the HealthKit

- Discuss lesson content and how it can be improved to better articulate concepts
- Share how you made the process fun, how you reminded yourself to show up daily to do the work

- Share tangible improvements you've made and measured with screens
- Share your approach to ensuring frequent, accurate screening 

- Share with others your intention to teach what you have learned. Who, when, how

- Share your challenges and seek support from others who have input/suggestions to offer
- Share your most powerful experiment
- Share how you plan to continue improving your foot health, challenges you are looking forward to, milestones you're setting for yourself

- Share how you are using the physical tools, your favourite shoes, your most memorable barefoot experience
- Share stories of conversations you had with family and friends
- Share the objections people have when you tell them about going barefoot or reducing time spent in chairs
