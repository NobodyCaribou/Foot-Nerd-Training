Continue your daily practice and foot health restoration project all the way through week 12 even as you plan and offer your event

Now is also a good time to regroup and refine your daily practice

Look at what other Foot Nerds are doing by browsing through the shared files here:

When observing other nerd's files, focus on the Foot Nerd files highlighted in green

They have completed their event and will have a debrief video or audio in their file

Listen, watch and learn from them as you prepare for your event

Before getting into week 8 content, here is a video of James and Nick sharing their stories and thoughts about leading TFC in person experiences:

1 ------- INTENTION

Teaching can be immensely rewarding

The process of mastering your delivery is energy intensive. It's hard work. It requires clarity, planning, coordination and practice

In order to overcome challenges and resistance to teaching, it's helpful to have a powerful intention

A motivating force. A sense of purpose that pushes us to persevere through the work

What is your intention? Your reason for teaching? Why do you want to do this?

Write it down in your log and refer back to those powerful words when things get tough or you start doubting yourself



2 ------- CONTENT

For your first event, we recommend opting for a shorter session and focusing on the experience

Choosing 60 or 120 min comes down to your preference and the audience you will be delivering the experience to

Your first event is a steep learning curve. Better to err on the side of shorter time and focus on higher quality minutes 

The templates are suggestions, not prescriptions. Pick one as a starting point and then make it your own by customizing it

Cover concepts you found most interesting on your learning journey during the first 6 weeks of training

Share stories from your own experience. Explain concepts in your own words. Add your own games. Develop your own unique delivery style

Play music that you like during play sessions

Share the misconceptions you moved beyond and the "aha" moments you had

Understand the fundamentals deeply so you can teach them to others in a simple, clear way

Essentials on a "shoes optional" walk:

- Facilitate introductions between people. Help them get to know each other
- Make the walk fun. Find things to balance on and hang on if possible
- Start the walk with some footwear education. Spend 5 minutes teaching the concept of natural footwear and why we recommend it
- Ask people to stick around after for a coffee or light snack. You can even encourage people to bring healthy snacks to share with others
- Finish the session by explaining what it means to be a Foot Nerd and offer to answer any questions people have
- Point everyone to join the community and engage with discussions and challenges

Essentials in every workshop:

- Lots of play. Make it fun, make it memorable
- Natural footwear education. The root cause of foot problems and the solution to resolving them is the shoes we wear
- Plantar reset and toe splay. Simple, practical and very powerful when done consistently
- Balance and squat screens
- Balance training. Lower body recalibration and focus training
- First principles
- Hips 101: help people understand why it's important to minimize chair time (with ground living) and why restoring a resting squat is important

Additional topics to cover if time permits: 
- Protect/correct/develop
- Pillars of health

Details:
- Will you give people a printed flowsheet or manual to follow along during the workshop and take home?
- Will you bring equipment with you to the workshop or offer products for sale?
- If you're planning to purchase equipment for your group, large or small, you can follow these instructions:

3 ------- BANDWIDTH, TIME, DESIRE

It seems to me that to accomplish anything worthwhile requires three elements (without them i've found it very hard to succeed)

1) Bandwidth: the mental space to engage with the process of learning or mastering a skill

2) Time: time blocked off and available for learning/practice. Tip: what gets scheduled gets done

3) Desire: This is where your intention and purpose are helpful. A strong feeling or yearning to achieve something. Without this, obstacles can easily
become roadblocks that stop you in your tracks. Your desire/motivation must exceed the difficulty of challenges you face in order to achieve success



4 ------- CONFIDENCE

Confidence is forged through work

Spending focused time everyday understanding and restoring healthy feet for 50+ days so far has given you a deep understanding of foot health

A more powerful understanding than I had as a physical therapist who graduated with a 2 year masters degree and treated many patients with foot issues

You have absorbed and practiced the knowledge that has taken 5 years, many brains and lots of experience to forge

Why am I writing this? Because you are likely underestimating how powerful the wisdom you possess truly is when directed to the right people

When it comes to leading events and teaching workshops, confidence is earned through deep understanding

Deep understanding is built through experience, practice, visualization and fueled by sense of purpose in helping others

Be confident and be humble. Have strong opinions loosely held

Be open minded but know that you have a community of foot nerds supporting you and witnessing you on your journey to become an awesome event leader



5 ------- CRAFTING YOUR WORKSHOP PLAYBOOK

Create your own cheat sheet. A set of guidelines that are updated with every workshop you deliver

A checklist of things to do in preparation for, during, and after each workshop

An evolving template that you can improve over time and compare with other nerds
