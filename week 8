[Work in progress. Completion deadline: 8.21.22]


Welcome to week 8 of foot nerd training. In your first week of workshop training and we cover:

1) Intention
2) Content
3) Bandwidth, time, desire
4) Confidence
5) Craft your workshop playbook
6) Details



1 ------- INTENTION

Teaching is energy intensive and hard work. It requires clarity, planning, coordination and practice

In order to overcome challenges and resistance to teaching, we must have a powerful intention. A motivating force

A sense of purpose that pushes us to persevere through the work

What is your intention? Your reason for teaching? Why do you want to do this?

Write it down in your pow log and refer back to those powerful words if things get tough or you start doubting yourself



2 ------- CONTENT

We currently offer 3 workshop templates for foot nerds to choose from

If you haven't taught a workshop before, we recommend choosing either the 60min or 120 min template

Your first workshop is a steep learning curve. Better to err on the side of shorter time and focus on higher quality minutes 

The templates are suggestions, not prescriptions. Pick one as a starting point and then make it your own by customizing it

Add points you found most interesting on your learning journey during the first 6 weeks of training

Share stories from your own experience. Explain concepts in your own words. Add your own games. Develop your own unique delivery style

Play music that you like during play sessions. 

Add stories from your experience. Share the misconceptions you moved beyond, the "aha" moments you had

Understand the fundamentals deeply so you can teach them to others in a simple, clear way

Essentials in every workshop:

- Lots of play. Make it fun, make it memorable
- Natural footwear. The root cause of foot problems and the solution to resolving them is the shoes we wear
- Plantar reset and toe splay. Simple, practical and very powerful when done consistently
- Balance training. Lower body recalibration and focus training
- Mental models/heuristics: PCD, pillars of health, tree of understanding
- Screens
- First principles
- Hips
- Ground living


Details:
- Will you give people a printed flowsheet or manual to follow along during the workshop and take home?
- Will you bring equipment with you to the workshop or offer products for sale?



3 ------- BANDWIDTH, TIME, DESIRE

To accomplish anything worthwhile requires three elements. Without them it's very hard to succeed

Bandwidth: the mental space to engage with the process of learning or mastering a skill

Time: time blocked off and available for learning/practice. Tip: what gets scheduled gets done

Desire: This is where your intention and purpose comes into things. A strong feeling or yearning to achieve something. Without this, obstacles can easily
become roadblocks that stop you in your tracks. Motivation must exceed the difficulty of challenges you face in order to achieve success


4 ------- CONFIDENCE

Confidence is forged through work

Spending one focused hour understanding and restoring healthy feet for 42 days has given you a deep understanding of foot health

A more powerful understanding than I had as a physical therapist who graduated with a 2 year masters degree and treated many patients with foot issues

You have absorbed and practiced the knowledge that has taken 5 years, many brains and lots of experience to forge

Why am I writing this? Because you are likely underestimating how powerful the wisdom you possess truly is when directed to the right people

When it comes to teaching workshops, confidence is earned through deep understanding, practice, visualization and a deep sense of purpose in helping others

Be confident and be humble. Have strong opinions loosely held. Be open minded but know that you have 180+ foot nerds supporting you and witnessing you on
your journey to become an awesome workshop leader



5 ------- CRAFT YOUR WORKSHOP PLAYBOOK

Create your own cheat sheet. A set of guidelines that are updated with every workshop you deliver and learn from

A checklist of things to do in preparation for, during, and after each workshop

An evolving template that you can improve over time
