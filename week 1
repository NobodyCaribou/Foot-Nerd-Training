Welcome to week 1 of Foot Nerd Training

To keep in context on Slack, please engage in the "#week1" channel to share stories, seek help or learn from other foot nerds

Today marks your first day of spending 1 focused hour per day restoring healthy feet

The material covered in week 1-6 is based on TFC's Foot & Ankle HealthKit and has been modified for foot nerds who go deeper into the concepts 
than average people working through the HealthKit

The daily hour will vary from day to day and from person to person. Here are examples of things you might fill that hour with:

- Reading github files
- Watching videos
- Planning out experiments
- Doing experiments
- Going for a walk barefoot or in natural footwear
- Training your balance
- Working to restore a resting squat position
- Connecting with other foot nerds on Slack
- Planning your workshop
- Having conversations about foot health with friends/family/coworkers

----

In week 1 we cover: 

1) Proof of work
2) Pain
3) Screens
4) Becoming a world class foot health authority

1 ------- PROOF OF WORK

HealthKit video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr_gHXplV0A

Proof of work is the tool we use to hold ourselves accountable

Taking notes everyday in our log is how we record data, but more importantly, those log entries serve as proof that we showed up and put in the work

Building a daily journalling habit can be tough

The challenge of not knowing what to write or even remembering to write can become obstacles to consistency

When making a commitment, having concrete ways to measure whether we're making good on our commitment is important for ensuring success

Writing everyday in your log is a clear and concrete way of proving that you showed up for yourself

The data you record serves as the raw ingredients for future analysis. Reviewing notes is when you detect patterns and determine whether you're making
progress or not. Whether your experiments are accomplishing what you intend them to accomplish.

Some days you might not write much. Sample entry:

[July 2 2022]
- Low energy today, busy day at work
- Watched the footwear video
- Purchased a pair of vivobarefoot shoes
- Spent 60 minutes on the floor watching netflix

Some days you might write a bit more. Sample entry:

[July 7 2022]
- Went for a 45 minute walk today in natural shoes without my phone
- My mind wandered towards work related things but I made an effort to focus on my breath and observing my surroundings
- Finished with 5 minutes barefoot on a variety of textures - cement, rocks, grass
- Did 5 minutes of balance work on my solemate, spent 30 seconds in a resting squat position and sat on the floor to take this note
- Tomorrow: Spend 20 minutes working on my squat position and improving ankle dorsiflexion

--

The focus isn't WHAT you write (over time it will get easier to record data that matters), it's THAT you wrote something. Showing up everyday is the goal.

Share your thoughts on proof of work (and samples of your pow log entries) in the #week1 channel on slack with other foot nerds



2 ------- PAIN

Pain is an imporant feedback signal that we must strive to learn from instead of ignoring

Pain is like a wise old man that teaches us lessons and guides us as we work to heal from an injury. Ignore the wise old man and we must repeat the lessons

Qualifying pain is important so we can look back on our data and detect patterns/trends. Detailed data = better results

Qualifiers: 
- location (where is it?)
- sharp or dull
- intermittent or constant
- intensity (0 to 10)
- movements/activities/positions that ease the pain
- movements/activities/positions that make the pain worse

Be curious about pain, don't fear it. Use it as a tool to better understand what is going on and whether things are progressing in the right direction



3 ------- SCREENS

Screens are an important feedback tool we can use to measure progress and objectively assess the results of our experiments

As Gray Cook says: If we aren't measuring, we're guessing

Gather baseline data on all screens and record results in your log

Screens are an important feedback tool for measuring progress. They help us confirm/refute whether our experiments are yielding the results we're after

Nuggets:
- Be precise, be honest, help others screen themselves and get baseline measurements
- Re-test weekly and even after a training/experiment session

Task: based on your screens, create 3 concrete objectives/aspirations to achieve by the end of foot nerd training and plan out how you will get there

Example: 
I'm currently unable to achieve a resting squat position. By the end of foot nerd training, I will be able to rest comfortably in a squat for 60 seconds 
while breathing deeply and calmly. My plan to get there is to systematically address mobility at my ankles (measured w KTW) with 5 minutes of daily 
dorsiflexion mobilizations, to increase my hip mobility by spending 30 minutes a day sitting on the floor in a variety of positions, training my balance 
for 5 minutes everyday and doing 20 slow, controlled squats daily before my morning coffee (and pausing in the bottom position to take a deep breath)

I will screen my resting squat every 7 days to measure progress and take notes on how it feels and what I will focus on for the next 7 days



4 ------- BECOMING A WORLD CLASS FOOT HEALTH AUTHORITY

** section was inspired by a chapter titled “top dog” in Beyond Order by Jordan Peterson **


Until recently, I very much disliked the term "expert"

Most of the "experts" I've met to date had far too much certainty that they knew everything there was to know on their respective topic

That certainty made them rigid in their thinking and inflexible to changing their mind

These individuals had often accumuated a lot of time in academia reading papers and books but few had much if any experiential knowledge to speak from

These experts seemed to have derived their confidence from letters next to their name, not from demonstrating competence that could be put to the test

In his book "Beyond Order", Jordan Peterson elaborates on the concept of what it means to be an authority on a subjet

In particular, he talks about how it’s a good thing to be an authority

Life is difficult and suffering is common. Ameliorating that suffering takes initiative, effort and ability

True authority is derived from ability and competence

False authority is derived from degrees which seem to have lost their validity as proxies of ability because of the outdated methods that conventional 
education continues to use. 

A few potent quotes from the book:

“If a problem is real, then the people who are best at solving the problem at hand should rise to the top. That is not power. That is the authority 
that properly accompanies ability”

“A responsible person decides to make a problem his/her problem and then works diligently towards its solution with other people in the most efficient 
manner possible”


My primary takewaways from his work:

Authority is earned through competence

It must be wielded honourably

Our ambition must be derived from a desire to solve genuine, serious problems

Authority is derived from competence

An authority is an expert on a subject. A group of people with official responsibility for a particular area of activity 



Foot Nerds are authorities in the realm of foot health

In short, foot nerd training aims to develop world class authorities via proof or work

Authorities that have the ability to effectively help others restore healthy feet because they have first done the work themselves


In 12 weeks you will become a proof of work foot health authority. Not because we say so, because you have done the work

What am I writing all of this? Because I want you to appreciate the value of the understanding you will gain during the next 12 weeks

By grasping the value of our understanding and the effectiveness with which it solves an important problem (foot dysfunction), we gain the confidence that
enables us to teach others
