Complete these things everyday: 

1) Daily practice (12-30 min)
2) Take a note (5-10 min)
3) Study a concept and practice explaining it (5-10 min)

Notable tasks/dates this week:

-> Do a chair audit: Record how much time (approx) you spend sitting in chairs each day for 7 days

-> On Feb 6 we have our first live pow orientation call at (time)

-> Be preprared to share a golden nugget from your first week and to explain any of these concepts: 1) daily pow log, 2) map to foot freedom

-> On Feb 7th (last day of week 1), set aside 30 minutes to review your notes from the past 6 days and extract a golden nugget

----

In week 1 we cover: 

1) Daily proof of work log [core concept #1]
2) Map to foot freedom [core concept #2]
3) Daily practice
4) Screens



1 ------- DAILY PROOF OF WORK LOG

Your daily proof of work (pow) log is your primary accountability tool. It's your daily journal entry about what you did to improve your foot health

Taking a note IS showing up. Write 1 or 2 short notes about what you're noticing as you learn and experiment.

In order to get the most from your notes, on the last day of each week spend 30 minutes reviewing your notes from the past week

Go into your pow log now and write a reminder on Feb 7,14,21,28 March 7,14,21,28 and April 4,11,18,25 to do that.

Might seem silly but having a prompt serves as an important reminder to get your note review done and protects us from forgetting


Taking notes everyday in our log is how we record precious data of how our bodies are changing over time

Building a daily journalling habit can be tough

The challenge of not knowing what to write or even remembering to write can become obstacles to consistency

Writing everyday in your log is a clear and concrete way of proving that you showed up for yourself

The data you record serves as the raw ingredients for future analysis

Reviewing notes is when you detect patterns and determine whether you're making progress or not

It's how we determine whether our experiments are accomplishing what we intend them to accomplish

Some days we might not write much. Sample entry:

[July 2 2022]
- Low energy today, busy day at work
- Studied the natural footwear concept
- Explained natural footwear to myself on a walk in 5 minutes
- Purchased a pair of vivobarefoot shoes
- Spent 60 minutes on the floor (instead of couch) watching netflix

Some days we might write a bit more. Sample entry:

[July 7 2022]
- Went for a 45 minute walk today in natural shoes without my phone
- My mind wandered towards work related things but I made an effort to focus on my breath and observing my surroundings
- Finished with 5 minutes barefoot on a variety of textures - cement, rocks, grass
- Did 5 minutes of balance work on my solemate, spent 30 seconds in a resting squat position and sat on the floor to take this note
- Tomorrow: Spend 20 minutes working on my squat position and improving ankle dorsiflexion

--

The focus isn't WHAT we write (over time it gets easier to record data that matters), it's THAT we wrote something. Showing up everyday is the goal

As Foot Nerds, our work is witnessed and reflected on by fellow Nerds on live pow calls

By being witnesses for others and having our work witnessed, we gain authority through our experience

Share your thoughts on proof of work (and samples of your pow log entries) in the #week1 channel on slack with other foot nerds




2 ------- MAP TO FOOT FREEDOM

When embarking on a journey, it helps to have a destination. At TFC, our destination is foot freedom - a place we call Basecamp

Making it to Basecamp means embarking on a 21 hour trek typically taken over the course of 6 weeks (42 days) which requires us to cross 5 checkpoints

We call these checkpoints the keys to foot freedom. They are simple yet powerful heuristics that offer clarity for the process of restoring healthy feet

Simple doesn't mean easy, but simple keeps us accountable. Simple protects us from getting distracted by novelty or complexity

The keys to foot freedom:

1) Mindset

Adopt a long term mindset and understand first principles

It's not a race. A little bit better everyday is the objective. Be patient. Trust the process and show up everyday

First principles to keep in mind (first principles are a core concept of FNT and will be expanded on in week 2):

- Our bodies are self healing
- Our bodies are self organizing
- Our bodies adapt specifically to the demands we impose upon them

Holding these principles as core truths allows us to reclaim confidence in our bodies

Instead of fragile and flawed, we can begin viewing our bodies as resilient, intelligent and adaptable


2) Feet & Footwear

Wear natural footwear and spend time barefoot

NOTE: for best results, work towards progressively eliminating unnatural footwear - cycle them out, go faster for faster results

--> beginner: natural footwear as daily shoes, 5 min barefoot walk daily
--> intermediate: 75% natural footwear
--> advanced: 100% natural footwear (eliminate unnatural footwear), barefoot hike, running in natural shoes

3) Balance

Become capable of standing on 1 foot barefoot with eyes closed for 60 seconds without making an error. If I can't, work on it until I can

--> beginner: daily practice (plantar release, toega, single leg clocks, squat position work - 15 minutes or less)
--> intermediate: Solemate play
--> advanced: balance beam play

4) Squat

Become capable of getting into a resting squat position for 2 minutes comfortably. If I can't, work towards it everyday until I can

--> beginner: 5 squats everyday. Pair it with an existing daily habit (coffee, bathroom)
--> intermediate: 50 active squats everyday, adopt deep squat as a resting position during the day
--> advanced: explore squat position mobility, tempo squats, loaded squats, single leg squats, squats on a beam


5) Sitting

Sit in chairs for 4 hours or less per day and if sitting in a chair, get up and move every 30 minutes

[begins with a chair sitting audit - log the amount of chair hours you accumulate in a week]

--> beginner: sit on the floor for 1 hour per day
--> intermediate: longer movement periods to break up sitting  
--> advanced: Eliminate chairs, 2 hours or less of daily chair sitting, explore mobility limits when on the floor



3 ------- DAILY PRACTICE

A daily foot care ritual. A commitment to restoring and maintaining healthy feet by implementing a short ritual everyday

A staple element of Foot Nerd Training and hardcoded element of your 84 days

This routine can take as little as 12 minutes and has the capacity over time to compound into stunning results

Below is a 12 minute template to get you started. Tweak it, customize it, make it your own

Over time, progress the intensity or duration of the elements as your body adapts and changes

1) Plantar release (90 seconds per side): (https://youtu.be/wVOkKYOxheE)
- Use a lacrosse ball or cork ball to release the muscles, fascia and joints of your feet

2) Toega (90 seconds per side): (https://youtu.be/GwWzlYPDPw8)
- Interlace your fingers between your toes
- Mobilize each toe manually (90 seconds per side)

3) Single leg clocks: (beam demo: https://youtu.be/OtiiAgjueEU)
- Stand on 1 leg
- With your floating leg touch each number on a clock face and tap beside your stance leg between each rep
- Tap your foot with feather light pressure
- for 90 seconds per side go clockwise and counter clockwise

4) Squat position mobility work:
- Spend 3 minutes working on your squat position
- Time in a resting squat
- Moving in and out of squat position (use assistance if needed)

Make this daily practice a ritual. Something you do everyday. Pair it with your morning coffee or meditation

Play with it. Make it fun. Invite others to join you. Share your daily practice with friends and family to inspire them to make a commitment of their own

If you want, share a video of your daily practice on Slack or Instagram so we can share it with the community



4 ------- SCREENS

Screens are how we verify our progress and validate the keys to foot freedom

Specific tools that help us monitor changes being achieved by implementing the keys in our lives

They are sources of feedback that confirm we're doing the right things to improve our foot health

They allow us to objectively measure the effects of our efforts


As Gray Cook says: "If we aren't measuring, we're guessing"

Gather baseline data this week on your squat and balance screens (the others are optional)

Complete your screens data sheet on weeks 1,6 and 12 and post them in the shared google drive (link is in slack)

We will meet on zoom twice month with other nerds also going through FNT (live proof of work calls)

During this call, we exchange observations with our peers, witnessing each other's process and offering feedback to one another

Nuggets:
- Be precise, be honest, help others screen themselves and get baseline measurements
- Re-test weekly and even after a training/experiment session
