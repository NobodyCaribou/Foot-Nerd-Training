INTRODUCTION

We are currently living through a major shift in how we think of education at every level from kindergarden to post graduate studies.

This article will focus specifically on post graduate degrees in health and aims to propose a new framework for becoming a health authority.

In 2015 I completed a two year masters degree in physical therapy and began treating musculoskeletal (msk) cases in a clinical setting. 

I applied what I learned in school with my patients but felt there was a bigger opportunity to help the people who came to me for help. 

I was trained to diagnose and treat symptoms of msk dysfunction. A narrowly defined scope of human health and a symptom focused approach. 

Despite training to be an "expert" in the physical body, I struggled with foot and back issues and wasn't able to resolve them with my current knowledge.

I embarked on a personal exploration to understand foot health deeply and to experiment with different approaches to restoring healthy feet.

On the other side of a 6 month deep dive into feet and lots of experimentation, I emerged with several key insights that led me to create TFC:

1) The process of restoring healthy feet is incredibly simple
2) My PT degree provided me with zero useful information on how to resolve my issues
3) Diagnosis and symptom treatment are the antithesis of health
4) Understanding is gained through experience, not through information

The understanding I gained through my own experience in resolving foot issues taught me valuable information I did not know before.

My ability to help others restore foot health was gained through experience, not through my degree in physical therapy. 

I realized that my ability to help others had nothing to do with my degree, and had everything to do with my experience in facing challenges first hand.

My credentials and authority as a physical therapist was proof of degree. 

This was gained from passing tests and spending time and energy learning information that proved to be of very little use (perhaps even worse than useless)

My understanding and ability to restore foot health was proof of work.

It was gained from personal experience. It was a result of restoring my own foot health and learning what actually works in real life.

Foot Nerd Training is a new framework for learning. A shift away from proof of degree and toward proof of work.

A framework that develops world class foot health authorities in a provable way. 

Not because they passed a test or because they paid to be certified. Because they led by example and have the proof to show for it.

This new framework is constantly evolving and improving as more people complete their 12 weeks and offer their feedback on the experience.

Foot Nerd Training marks a shift away from disease care (diagnosis of disease and treatment of symptoms) and towards healthcare (understanding and
addressing the root cause of dysfunction)

It is a shift away from memorization of information and toward deep understanding gained through experience and sharing of stories. 

A transition away from broadcast unidirectional teaching to bidirectional dialogue between individuals who are taking responsibility and investing energy
into their own process in order to restore their foot function and determine truth.

Thank you for reading this. Thank you for being part of this community and for helping to pioneer a proof of work education framework that will lead us
into a new era of human health.
