INTRODUCTION

We're currently living through a major shift in how we think of education at every level from kindergarden to post graduate studies.

For this article, I will focus specifically on post graduate degrees in health and aim to propose a new framework for becoming a health authority.

In 2015 I completed a two year masters degree in physical therapy and began treating musculoskeletal (msk) cases in a clinical setting. 

I applied what I learned in school with my patients but felt there was a bigger opportunity to help the people who came to me for help. 

I was trained to diagnose and treat symptoms of msk dysfunction. A narrowly defined scope of human health and a symptom focused palliative approach. 

Despite training to be an "expert" in the physical body, I struggled with foot and back issues and wasn't able to resolve them with the knowledge I 
acquired over the course of my PT training.

I embarked on a personal exploration to understand foot health deeply and to experiment with different approaches to restoring healthy feet.

On the other side of a 6 month deep dive into feet and lots of experimentation, I emerged with several key insights that led me to create TFC:

1) The process of restoring healthy feet is incredibly simple
2) My PT degree provided me with no useful information on how to resolve my issues
3) Diagnosis and symptom treatment are the antithesis of health
4) Understanding is gained through experience, not through information

The understanding I gained through my own experience in resolving foot issues taught me valuable information I did not know before.

My ability to help others restore foot health was gained through experience, not through my degree in physical therapy. 

I realized that my ability to help others had nothing to do with my degree, and had everything to do with my experience in facing challenges first hand.

My credentials and authority as a physical therapist was proof of degree. 

This was gained from passing tests and spending time and energy learning information that proved to be of very little use (perhaps even worse than useless)

My understanding and ability to restore foot health was proof of work.

It was gained from personal experience. It was a result of restoring my own foot health and learning what actually works in real life.

Foot Nerd Training is a new framework for learning. A shift away from proof of degree and toward proof of work.

A framework that develops world class foot health authorities in a provable way. 

Not because they passed a test or because they paid to be certified. Because they led by example and have the proof to show for it (their foot health)

This new framework is constantly evolving and improving as more people complete their 12 weeks and offer their feedback on the experience.

Foot Nerd Training marks a shift away from disease care (diagnosis of disease and treatment of symptoms) and towards healthcare (understanding and
addressing the root cause of dysfunction)

It is a shift away from memorization of information and toward deep understanding gained through experience and sharing of stories. 

A transition away from broadcast unidirectional teaching to bidirectional dialogue between individuals who are taking responsibility and investing energy
into their own process in order to restore their foot function and determine truth.

Thank you for reading this. Thank you for being part of this community and for helping to pioneer a proof of work education framework that will lead us
into a new era of human health.

VALUE

When I look back on the amount of money, time and energy that was put into my 2 years masters degree in physical therapy, I can't help but think that
it provided very little value in terms of providing me the ability to help patients with their health. That said, it wasn't a complete waste of time.

I learned detailed anatomy and physiology, met amazing people, learned from experienced clinicians on my placements and gained a prestigious certification 
that granted me immediate job opportunities that paid a competitive salary.

What I didn't learn was that the human body is an amazing self healing, self organizing structure that directly adapts to how we use it.

I didn't learn that sitting in chairs all day and wearing unnatural footwear are primary causes of dysfunction. 

I didn't learn anything about health or how the food we eat, the sleep we get, the sense of community we have or the state of our minds affects the
physical body. 

I learned everything about disease and how to help people manage their symptoms, but nothing about health and how to empower people to restore it.

I guess it all boils down to how one determines value - a subjective estimate of what something is worth.

I guess a question to ask ourselves is: what do we value? 

Do we value letters next to our name? 
Do we value being recognized as the holder of a degree?
Do we value job safety?
Do we value meaningful work?
Do we value being part of an aligned learning community seeking to help one another?
Do we value continued learning?
Do we value truth?
Do we value thinking for ourselves?

If we're spending our time and energy on a degree in order to learn from the "knowers", what happens when the "knowers" are teaching ineffective, 
outdated information that no longer applies to the new world we find ourselves living within?

If learning is a perpetual process, what is the value of acquiring a degree that reflects only a snapshot of knowledge in time?

Our aim with Foot Nerd Training is to offer value through 3 primary avenues: commitment, clarity and community [expand]

We aim to empower students with a framework they can apply perpetually in their quest for mastery within the domain of foot health.

A shared and constantly evolving knowledge base that emerges from our collective experience.

We don't provide the answers, we offer a template for a process that allows individuals to discover their own answers and a forum through which we can all
share and compare the answers we have discovered. 

We offer value by supporting people in their quest to become a world class foot health authority. Not because we said so. Because they did the work and
have proof to back it up. 

We witness each other as equals instead of teaching from a place of superiority. The nerd herd is a meritocracy where the best ideas rise to the top and
those with the most experience help those beginning their journey.
