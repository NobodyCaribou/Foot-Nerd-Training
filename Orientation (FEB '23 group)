1 ------- CHECKLIST 

Before Feb 1, complete the following:

1) Prepare a proof of work (pow) log. A journal with at least 84 pages. This is where you will take notes everyday
2) Familiarize yourself with GitHub, email Ruth if you have any issues navigating the content
3) Login to Slack and introduce yourself in the #orientation channel- add a photo, say who you are, where you are, why you're doing this
4) Schedule your daily hour. Block off the time. What time will you do it? Where will you do it? How will you remind yourself?


2 ------- YOUR DAILY HOUR

Here are the 4 essentials of the daily hour:

1) Your daily practice (12-30 minutes). A consistent daily ritual of restoring and training your lower body

2) Taking notes (5-10 minutes).  Write a note in your pow log about what you're learning/noticing

3) Study a concept and practice explaining it (to yourself or to a partner/friend/family member/coworker)

4) On the last day of each week, review your notes. Pick the most important golden nugget (something you've learned or noticed)

Be prepared to share it with us on our live call.

Dedicating 60 focused minutes a day for 84 consecutive days seems like a simple task, but it becomes difficult if you don't prepare and plan ahead

In a chaotic distraction-centric world, Foot Nerd focus is a superpower so protect your energy and train your concentration

Focused attention is where deep work happens. It's where results are created. It's where insights are achieved. Go Foot Nerds!

1 focused hour can generate better results than 5 distracted hours

Be aware of your blind spots and how you, personally, get distracted

Success requires courage, clarity and commitment

For Courage: Take responsibility by beginning again and again - even when you get derailed by life

For Clarity: Plan for your success, protect yourself from distraction and remind yourself why you're doing this

For Commitment: Do what you said you were going to do. Keep your word to yourself first and foremost (Begin again)


In order to clarify your commitment to Foot Nerd Training, answer these questions:

1) How do I define a dedicated hour? 
2) When will I complete my daily hour? How will I remind myself to do it? How will I track whether I'm succeeding or not?
3) How will I hold myself accountable? Who else can help support me along this journey?

If you lose your way and get off the path of completing your daily hour, give yourself grace, seek support if you need it and begin again

This isn't a race, it's a process. Foot Nerds are here to support you and we are all doing this together

A glimpse of your daily hour:

- Learning a concept and teaching it to someone
- Going for a walk barefoot or in natural footwear
- Training your balance
- Working to restore a resting squat position
- Planning your event
- Taking notes
- Having conversations about foot health with friends/family/coworkers

6 ------- SLACK & GITHUB

Slack has served as our virtual town square where foot nerds from around the globe connect, ask questions, and seek help

There are dedicated channels for each of the 12 weeks

Please keep in context by engaging in the correct channel based on where you are in your 12 weeks

Use the feedback channel to let us know how we can make foot nerd training better for you and for future nerds

Starting February 1, 2023 we will be transitioning TFC to a new digital home and creating a private space to replace Slack where foot nerds can connect

--

Github is where we host all foot nerd training content

Each week of training has it's own Github file which contains the content for that week

You will also find these in our GitHub files: 

Library: a categorized repository of resources curated and created by foot nerds

Experiments: a searchbase of experiment templates categorized by screen for you to choose from

Dialogue covenant: The document that governs how we have conversations and disagreements within the foot nerd community (covered further in point 6)



7 ------- DIALOGUE COVENANT

This is our shared agreement that governs how foot nerds interact with one another in dialogue
                                   
The convenant is created, edited and upheld by foot nerds

Itâ€™s our intention to create and maintain a productive space for intellectual disagreement and generative conversations

9 ------- WEEK 10: LEAD YOUR EVENT

An imporant part of foot nerd training is bringing people together and sharing your understanding

In week 10 (or close to then) you will organize an event for your local community and receive a value exchange for your work

Your event can be a shoes optional walk, a more formal workshop, or both (we highly encourage taking on the workshop challenge)

Although 9 weeks seems like a long time from now, the earlier you begin planning your session, the better preprared you will be

Knowing you will be sharing your newly acquired foot health wisdom with others creates deeper meaning in your learning journey over weeks 1-6

You aren't just taking daily notes for yourself, you're also taking them for others with whom you will share your experience with

5 details to begin thinking about and finalize over the next few weeks:

- When will you offer your event? (date/time)
- Where will you host it? (location)
- Who will you invite? (participants)
- What will you offer and how much will it cost to register? (length, price)
- How will you exchange value with participants? (payment method)

Spending time thinking about these details is how you begin evisioning your event

Schedule it. Start telling people about it. Think about where you will host it (outdoor space? yoga/gym facility? your home?)

All of our actions begin as ideas. The more clear the idea, the easier it is to plan and bring your project into reality

Detailed event training is covered in weeks 8,9 and 10 to prepare you with everything you need to plan, prepare and confidently deliver a great event



10 ------- FEEDBACK

Foot nerd training is a constantly evolving framework and our team is focused on constantly improving the 12 week experience

Every person who works through training helps make it better by offering constructive feedback

We created a #feedback channel on slack and will check it weekly. We need your help to make foot nerd training better for participants

If at any point you have an idea about how we can improve the experience, please share your thoughts on Slack
