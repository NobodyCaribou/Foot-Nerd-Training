Ruth & Nick raw notes on FNT upgrades

---> Ruth raw notes
About the questions we ask nerds to answer - more specific questions that naturally prompt a concrete reflection on the experience
Add an orientation week zoom check-in for those that would like to have that?
Adding a group call on week 4 & 7 (30 minute calls and one of them linked to TFC monthly community call)
Adding the intial POW worksheet submitted to the group channel #week 1 and #week 6
- Week 1 POW summary (word doc/pdf?) to submit to week 1 channel has baseline data from all nerds and notes they took about their process
- Week 1 POW summary (word doc/pdf?) has the 3 concrete objectives for FNT
- Week 6 POW summary has comparisons - week 1 baseline data and week 6 rescreens along with relevant notes
- Week 6 POW summary has 3 objectives: 1. Did you meet your objective? Why or why not? same for number 2 and number 3
Maybe bi-weekly checkins on slack for rescreens 2, 4 and 6 weeks checkin with rescreens? Or maybe just the week 1 and week 6 would be enough?
Hardcoding days off to rest, integrate



Possible Questions:
1. what were your 3 concrete objectives?
2. did they change? if so, how?
3. what was your most effective experiment or sequence of experiments
4. which screen gave you the most surpising information about your movement patterns?
5. which experiment was the most helpful in meeting your objectives?
6. share your most effective DF experiment? :) your "   " balance experiment? squat? hip mobility? 



---> Nick notes

- Hardcode weekly screen update posted for peers to witness (video or written in slack)
- Experiment library: use input from herd to expand, weekly prompt in lesson file about the library and how to apply it
- Hardcode video debrief after leading workshop. Share with the herd for hive mind learning and to be witnessed. 

Answer: 
What did you enjoy? 
What challenged you?
What did you learn?
What are you going to do different next time?
Words of inspiration for nerds starting FNT and getting ready to deliver their first workshop 

- Mac: a masterclass on building an e-commerce business with TFC (distribute products locally, be listed on the website
- Ruth & Nick: Monthly debrief (PL, input from nerds who have completed training)

Insight: Proof of work education is replacing proof of degree academia
