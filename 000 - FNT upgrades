Ruth & Nick raw notes on FNT upgrades




What do you mean we interact with each other? 
when? 
how? 
You say there is guidance and support...what does that entail specifically? 
Do the teachers observe our practice and/or teaching? 

 
 - Is it online?
 - Is it live?
 - Are the modules taped?
 - Are they modules?
 - Who is this for?
 - What kind of experience do I need to have beforehand?
 - What kind of classes do you prepare us to teach?
 - What do you mean we interact with other? When? How? 
 - You say we have guidance, support? What does that entail specifically?
 - Do the teachers observe our practice and/or teaching?
 


The 12 week training is a digital self paced rigorous training program to help you restore your own foot health by dedicating 1 hour per day to the lessons and experiments. You take baseline data in the form of photos, videos and measurements, share them with us and your peers and at the end of 6 weeks you will do the same and reflect on the changes you've made - share them with your peers and the global TFC community.
The first 6 weeks have you working on your own foot health. We interact with other Foot Nerds who are in the program at the same time on Slack, our digital office space, if you. 

The second phase: week 7-12 is workshop training where you learn about how to create a workshop for your community, based on what you've learned in the first 6 six weeks.

About the questions we ask nerds to answer - more specific questions that naturally prompt a concrete reflection on the experience

Add an orientation week zoom check-in for those that would like to have that?

Adding a group call on week 4 & 7 (30 minute calls and one of them linked to TFC monthly community call)

Adding the intial POW worksheet submitted to the group channel #week 1 and #week 6
- Week 1 POW summary (word doc/pdf?) to submit to week 1 channel has baseline data from all nerds and notes they took about their process
- Week 1 POW summary (word doc/pdf?) has the 3 concrete objectives for FNT
- Week 6 POW summary has comparisons - week 1 baseline data and week 6 rescreens along with relevant notes
- Week 6 POW summary has 3 objectives: 1. Did you meet your objective? Why or why not? same for number 2 and number 3

Maybe bi-weekly checkins on slack for rescreens 2, 4 and 6 weeks checkin with rescreens? Or maybe just the week 1 and week 6 would be enough?

Hardcoding days off to rest, integrate


Possible Questions:
1. what were your 3 concrete objectives?
2. did they change? if so, how?
3. what was your most effective experiment or sequence of experiments
4. which screen gave you the most surpising information about your movement patterns?
5. which experiment was the most helpful in meeting your objectives?
6. share your most effective DF experiment? :) your "   " balance experiment? squat? hip mobility?

Priorities:
- Week 1 baseline screens posted. Hardcoded. Link included in week 1 to dropbox file to input data and post for other nerds to witness in slack
- Week 7 reflection document hardcoded and posted in week 7 lesson file for nerds to complete and post to slack
- Week 12 reflection document (or video) hardcoded. Workshop debrief. Input data and post in slack for other nerds to witness. 

Q's to answer : What did you enjoy? What challenged you?, What did you learn?, What are you going to do different next time?

Words of inspiration for nerds starting FNT and getting ready to deliver their first workshop 

- FNT details posted to website in "FAQ" document. Dynamic document - we continue adding to it over time as questions come in from community




- Experiment library: use input from herd to expand, weekly prompt in lesson file about the library and how to apply it
 
- Mac: a masterclass on building an e-commerce business with TFC (distribute products locally, be listed on the website
- Ruth & Nick: Monthly debrief (PL, input from nerds who have completed training)

Insight: Proof of work education is replacing proof of degree academia
