1 ------- CHECKLIST 

Before starting training on Feb 1, complete these tasks:

1) Prepare a proof of work (pow) log. A journal with at least 84 pages. This is where you will take notes everyday
2) Familiarize yourself with GitHub, email Ruth if you have any issues navigating the content
3) Login to Slack and introduce yourself in the #orientation channel
4) Schedule your daily hour. Block off the time. What time will you do it? Where will you do it? How will you remind yourself?

2 ------- YOUR DAILY HOUR

What you do during your daily hour will vary widely but there are some crucial essentials that should be done everyday

1) Your daily practice (12-30 minutes). A consistent daily ritual of restoring and training your lower body

2) Taking notes (5-10 minutes). Everyday you write a note in your pow log about what you did, what you learned, obstacles and insights

3) Learning a concept and practicing explaining it (to yourself or teaching it to a friend/family member/coworker)

Dedicating 60 focused minutes a day for 84 consecutive days may seem like a simple task, but in today's busy world, it can be very difficult

Human attention has become a commodity that companies spend billions of dollars fighting for, and so most of us end up getting distracted

In a chaotic distraction-centric world, focus is a superpower for those who can protect their energy and train their concentration

Focused attention is where deep work happens. It's where results are created. It's where insights are achieved

Focus is how we achieve in 1 hour what would typically take us several hours if distracted

Success requires courage, clarity and commitment

The courage to take responsibility, the clarity of what is important, and the commitment to achieve what you set out to do

The clarity to form a plan and to protect ourselves from distraction so we can focus on achieving what we set out to do

A simple, clear commitment that we can use to hold ourselves accountable and keep on track

In order to clarify your commitment within Foot Nerd Training, answer these questions:

1) How do I define a dedicated hour? 
2) When will I complete my daily hour? How will I remind myself to do it? How will I track whether I'm succeeding or not?
3) How will I hold myself accountable? Who else can help support me along this journey?

If you lose your way and get off the path of completing your daily hour, do not be hard on yourself. Give yourself grace and simply begin again

This isn't a race, it's a process. Foot Nerds are here to support you and we are all doing this together

The daily hour will vary from day to day and from person to person. Here are examples of things you might fill that hour with:

- Your daily practice
- Learning a concept and teaching it to someone
- Going for a walk barefoot or in natural footwear
- Training your balance
- Working to restore a resting squat position
- Planning your event
- Taking notes
- Having conversations about foot health with friends/family/coworkers
