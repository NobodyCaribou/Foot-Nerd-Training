1 ------- CHECKLIST 

Before starting training on Feb 1, complete these tasks:

1) Prepare a proof of work (pow) log. A journal with at least 84 pages. This is where you will take notes everyday
2) Familiarize yourself with GitHub, email Ruth if you have any issues navigating the content
3) ????? Login to Slack and introduce yourself in the #orientation channel
4) Schedule your daily hour. Block off the time. What time will you do it? Where will you do it? How will you remind yourself?



2 ------- YOUR DAILY HOUR

What you do during your daily hour will vary widely over the next 84 days. With that said, here are 4 essentials that should be done everyday:

1) Your daily practice (12-30 minutes). A consistent daily ritual of restoring and training your lower body

2) Taking notes (5-10 minutes). Everyday you write a note in your pow log about what you did, what you learned, obstacles and insights

3) Study a concept and practice explaining it (to yourself or to a partner/friend/family member/coworker)

4) On the last day of each week, spend 30 minutes reviewing your notes from the week and extracting a golden nugget

Dedicating 60 focused minutes a day for 84 consecutive days may seem like a simple task, but in todays busy world, it can prove difficult

Human attention has become a commodity that companies spend billions of dollars fighting for, and so many of us end up getting distracted

In a chaotic distraction-centric world, focus is a superpower for those who can protect their energy and train their concentration

Focused attention is where deep work happens. It's where results are created. It's where insights are achieved

1 focused hour can generate more results than 5 distracted hours

Success requires courage, clarity and commitment

The courage to take responsibility, the clarity to know what is important, and the commitment to achieve what you set out to do

Clarity is achieved by planning for success and protecting ourselves from distraction so we can focus on achieving what we set out to do

A simple, clear commitment allows us to hold ourselves accountable and keep on track

In order to clarify your commitment to Foot Nerd Training, answer these questions:

1) How do I define a dedicated hour? 
2) When will I complete my daily hour? How will I remind myself to do it? How will I track whether I'm succeeding or not?
3) How will I hold myself accountable? Who else can help support me along this journey?

If you lose your way and get off the path of completing your daily hour, do not be hard on yourself

Give yourself grace, seek support if you need it and focus on getting back on track

This isn't a race, it's a process. Foot Nerds are here to support you and we are all doing this together

Here are ideas for things you might fill your daily hour with

- Your daily practice
- Learning a concept and teaching it to someone
- Going for a walk barefoot or in natural footwear
- Training your balance
- Working to restore a resting squat position
- Planning your event
- Taking notes
- Having conversations about foot health with friends/family/coworkers

5 ------- WHAT IS A FOOT NERD

A foot nerd is someone who:

- Explores health deeply, starting with their feet
- Spends time barefoot
- Leads by example
- Takes excellent care of themselves
- Makes income helping others restore excellent health starting with feet

We love to play, are open minded, enjoy good faith disagreements and invest energy everyday into our health

We find purpose in being health resources for our local communities (Healthnodes within the global TFC network)

We feel it's always better to learn than to be right

We view science as the adult word for play

We understand that science is not a perfect tool but it's the best one we have right now for determining truth



6 ------- PROOF OF WORK CALLS

Why do we do them?

What are they?

What is expected?

When do we do them?



7 ------- SLACK & GITHUB

Slack has served as our virtual town square in cyberspace where foot nerds from around the globe connect with one another

It's the plaform we use to seek help and connect with one another

There are dedicated channels for each week. Please keep in context by engaging in the correct channel based on where you are in your 12 weeks

Use the feedback channel to let us know how we can make foot nerd training better for you and for future nerds 

Starting February 1, 2023 we will be transitioning TFC to a new digital home and creating a private space to replace Slack where foot nerds can connect

--

Github is where we host all foot nerd training content

It's a robust platform that allows us to continually update and evolve the materials covered during training

Each week of training has it's own Github file which contains the content for that week

Library: a categorized repository of resources curated and created by foot nerds

Experiments: a searchbase of experiment templates categorized by screen for you to choose from

Dialogue covenant: The document that governs how we have conversations and disagreements within the foot nerd community (covered further in point 6)



8 ------- DIALOGUE COVENANT

This is our shared agreement that governs how foot nerds interact with one another in dialogue. Our rules of engagement for discourse
                                   
Created, edited and upheld by foot nerds

It’s our intention to create and maintain a productive space for intellectual disagreement and generative conversations

We aspire to become a community of individuals who can respectfully challenge each others perspectives and where each indidivual is heard

Together we maintain a safe environment for discourse, underlined by love and understanding

We’re here to learn from each other and contribute our varied experiences and backgrounds to the collective knowledge base

In doing so, we create diversity. Diversity is important because a wide variety of perspectives breeds immunity from bias

We work towards a space where fear is eliminated and every nerd is safe to speak what he/she believes to be true without the danger of repercussions


What this means for you:

Each nerd agrees to help foster a safe environment for discourse and debate

We will use Slack and Zoom (as needed) as forums where we can have discussions on controversial topics

When topics come up and nerds want to have a debate/discussion, a temporary channel will be created on Slack and the discourse will be held there

If a Zoom call is appropriate, nerds can propose, announce and schedule discussions that are open for all foot nerds to participate in

When needed, a mediator will lead the conversation and the discussion covenant will be enforced objectively by every participant involved


All nerds agree that conversations will be conducted with respect, will be constructive and that each person involved is participating in good faith

Good faith can be defined as: 

Contributing to the discussion honestly and fairly and agreeing to follow the guidelines for creating an environment of safety and trust

Everyone who agrees to the covenant (aka agreement) is also an arbiter to ensure that it is respected and enforced

It protects everyone within the space. The covenant is an evolving document

You can view the current version by selecting the dialogue covenant file from the README summary
