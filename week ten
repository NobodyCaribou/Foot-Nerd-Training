[Work in progress. Completion deadline: 9.15.22]

Welcome to week 10 of foot nerd training. In your final week of workshop training we cover:

1) Controlling the controllables
2) Being adaptable
3) Leading by example
4) Final prep for your first workshop
5) Creating your checklist
6) Having fun 



1 ------- CONTROLLING THE CONTROLLABLES

The serenity prayer contains a lot of wisdom. It goes something like this:

Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference

Controlling the controllables is all about focusing on the things you have control over. Things like:

- The quality of sleep you get the night before teaching
- Having a clear mind to focus on your session
- Planning your session in detail
- Practicing the material and your delivery
- Setting a good example when demonstrating screens (proof of work)
- Having written materials and equipment ready on the day of your workshop
- Not overthinking or worrying about things that haven't happened yet (and usually don't end up happening)

Things you can't control:
- A power outage
- The facility owner running late
- Your child getting sick the day before the workshop
- People forgetting to show up

Control the controllables. Your inputs, your energy, your work. Focus your energy on the things you are in control of

Adapt to the circumstances you don't control. Always make the best of every situation and know this: things can always be worse



2 ------- BEING ADAPTABLE

Create contingency plans

Focus on delivering a great experience, even if that experience doesn't end up being exactly what you planned

Make the best of every situation that arises and keep a positive mindset

Adapt your delivery to the people in your session. If something doesn't go to plan, flow with it. Don't get rattled

The obstacles we face end up guiding us to the best possible outcomes. Remember that



3 ------- LEADING BY EXAMPLE

"Showing is better than telling" - Timothy Gallwey, author of The Inner Game of Tennis

Your authority as a teacher comes from your understanding and your proof of work (your foot health)

Part of being a competent teacher is consistently practicing what you teach

In order to authentically communicate the beneits of natural footwear, ground living and balance, you must have experienced those benefits yourself

Share stories of where you started, how you got to where you currently are, and how you maintain functional capacity through your lifestyle

You need to be able to demonstrate foundational capacity on screens (or be actively working towards that capacity)

Your daily effort to restore healthy feet is what teaches you the lessons you are now passing onto others

People learn much more from the behaviours they watch us do than the words they hear us say



4 ------- FINAL PREPARATION

Write down the names of everyone who has registered/paid so you can mark them off

Send everyone an email 1-2 days before the session to remind them and also set expecations (show up 15min early to register, this is when we start, 
bring water, wear clothes you can move in, bring something to write with, be ready to be barefoot, bring questions, bring a smile)



5 ------- CREATING YOUR CHECKLIST

A checklist is a written tool that helps reduce the memory burden of remembering everything you need to do

It helps ensure consistency when carrying out a task and reduces the risk of forgetting something or making an error

Your checklist is an evolving document. It begins very simple and is added to, moulded and evolved with every workshop experience you lead

Recommendation: begin with a single sheet of paper (your master checklist) and divide it into three sections: 

1) Lead up (things to be done before your workshop)
2) Day of (things to be done on the day of your workshop)
3) Day after (things to be done on the day after your workshop)

Here are a few samples of items that might be on your master checklist:

Lead up
- Mock practice of session intro (first 5 min)
- Review material the night before
- Reminder email sent to participants (when to arrive, what to do on arrival, facility rules, tools/equipment for sale & how to pay for them)
- Handouts printed
- Music playlist created
- Details confirmed with host
- Equipment & tools ordered with a safety buffer of time to ensure they arrive on time
- Good PM routine night before your session to ensure a good sleep

Day of event
- Calm, focused morning
- Well hydrated
- Pack up handouts, water bottle, snack, registration list, equipment/tools 
- Leave early to ensure you arrive 15min early to speak with host
- Ask participants for consent to take pictures

Day after event
- Written reflection of the experience (what went well, challenges faced, things to improve for next time)
- Update checklist for next time if new items should be added
- Follow up email to participants and host (thanking them, sending resources, seeking feedback)



6 ------- HAVING FUN

If you're having fun teaching your workshop, it's likely that the people you're teaching will also have fun

Leading a workshop is hard work but on the day of the session, smiling and enjoying yourself is really important

You've spent the time creating an awesome offering, have practiced your delivery, now it's time to execute
