[Work in progress. Completion deadline: 8.21.22]

Welcome to week 10 of foot nerd training. In your final week of workshop training we cover:

1) Controlling the controllables
2) Being adaptable
3) Leading by example
4) Final prep for your first workshop
5) Creating a checklist (day before, day of)
6) Having fun (if you have fun, everyone will have fun. Work hard but smile and enjoy yourself)



1 ------- CONTROLLING THE CONTROLLABLES

The serenity prayer contains a lot of wisdom. It goes something like this:

Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference

Controlling the controllables is all about focusing on the things you have control over. Things like:

- The quality of sleep you get the night before teaching
- Having a clear mind to focus on your session
- Planning your session in detail
- Practicing the material and your delivery
- Setting a good example when demonstrating screens (proof of work)
- Having written materials and equipment ready on the day of your workshop
- Not overthinking or worrying about things that haven't happened yet (and usually don't end up happening)

Things you can't control:
- A power outage
- The facility owner running late
- Your child getting sick the day before the workshop
- People forgetting to show up

Control the controllables. Your inputs, your energy, your work. Focus your energy on the things you are in control of

Adapt to the circumstances you don't control. Always make the best of every situation and know this: things can always be worse


2 ------- BEING ADAPTABLE



3 ------- LEADING BY EXAMPLE

4 ------- FINAL PREPARATION

write down the names of everyone who has registered/paid so you can mark them off

Send everyone an email 1-2 days before the session to remind them and also set expecations (show up 15min early to register, this is when we start, 
bring water, wear clothes you can move in, bring something to write with, be ready to be barefoot, bring questions, bring a smile)



5 ------- CREATING A CHECKLIST

a master checklist

day before checklist

day after checklist

3) Leading by example
4) Final prep for your first workshop
5) Creating a checklist (day before, day of)
6) Having fun (if you have fun, everyone will have fun. Work hard but smile and enjoy yourself)



-----
Checklist:

- Good sleep, hydrated
- Review material day/night before
- Morning review
- Bring registration list
- Arrive 15min early to speak with host


- Taking lots of pictures
- Music choices for play sessions


Understanding concepts through experience

Distilling your understanding into wisdom

Crafting a memorable experience (blending connection, play & education)


Leading by example: be able to demo screens with competence. Proof of work: show people what they should be able to do, share stories of where you started
and how you got to where you currently are (and how you maintain it)

-------
[Practice]

Getting good at anything requires practice

To become a world class teacher requires a mindset of mastery. A desire to be a powerful inspiration to others and an effective resource to guide people
to resources and tools that help them do what they want to do

I put a lot of work into my first workshop. In hindsight, it wasn't very good but at the time it seemend like a captivating and useful session that 
would help get people on the path to healthier feet. It was the best I knew at the time and I took pride in the effort expended to create the topic flow,
print out booklets, practice my talking points, reviewing and sharpening material and building confidence to deliver the material effectively

Despite the peparation and energy put into the workshop, my first one rough. I was nervous, I was stressed, things didn't go to plan, I didn't cover 
everything I wanted to and I was doubting myself. I was hard on myself because I cared. Because I wanted to deliver a really awesome experience and the 
workshop didn't feel like it was meeting my expectations

By the end, I was pleasantly surprised when people told me how much they enjoyed the session and how many new useful things they learned

Moral of the story: Growth doesn't come from doing easy things you feel qualified to do. It comes from doing hard things that push your limits.

A great workshop results from hard work, giving your best effort, deeply understanding and having conviction in the information you're sharing and enjoying
the process of growing as a person by doing scary things that push you to get better. 

-------
Elements of a high quality experience:
- Inspiring leader
- Fun (lots of play)
- Informative (wisdom, point to resources)
- Practical (immediately applicable concepts)

-------

Idea: part of FNT is offering an education experience. Small or large. To get your dogtag and be a true foot nerd, you must have given a workshop

Small: invite 3 friends over (bribe them with food) and give them a free session, collect feedback
medium: approach a gym/yoga studio and offer a 2 hour experience for 5-10 people
large: organize a half day workshop at a local gym/fitness facility, coordinate toolkits for everyone

FNT is a commitment to growing as a person. Growing your knowledge by restoring your foot health, making a commitment to spread the message in your
community and get paid to do that

**ordering equipment 
- Value exchange is mandatory. Barter if they want (make a nice meal for me) or monetary exchange (even if with friends and family) - why its important
- Elements that make up a high quality, pleasant, memorable, educational, fun experience
- Lessons from teachers (Ruth & Nick)
- What makes up a pleasant teaching experience?

- Planning your workshop: What (customize template), when (schedule it), for who (invite ppl), payment methods, how (preparation involved?)
- Walk through template: details from my perspective

2-4 hour in person experiences




Keys to organizing a great workshop

The responsibility of teaching

can be independently scheduled or promoted/scheduled/booked through TFC (20-50%)

-------

- Being adaptable in your delivery
- Confidence is the result of deep understanding
- Mastery mindset. Always seeking to improve content, always seeking feedback, always seeking to improve our delivery
- Deliver sticky golden nuggets (4f's, natural footwear, ground living), focus on the experience. Play is the way
- Excellence through preparation
- Lead by example: ability on screens
- Attention to details (punctuality, timechecks, caring for the hosting facility)


Rituals:
- re-writing my notes the afternoon before the session (90min)
- debrief (what was good? what can be improved? what challenged me? did I have fun?)
