Welcome to week 12 of Foot Nerd training and congratulations on making it here

The focus this week is reflection and integration. The objective is to debreif yourself from the past 11 weeks to extract wisdom from your journey

De-brief defined: To question yourself systematically in order to obtain useful intelligence or information

The past 11 weeks have been busy. Learning new concepts, engaging with a daily practice, changes in your body, and hopefully lots of notes

Now it's time to review your notes, reflect on the experiences, and ask yourself some questions:

- What were the most memorable moments?
- What were the toughest challenges?
- What results did you achieve?
- What are the most impactful lessons learned?
- What are your most powerful insights about restoring foot health?
- How do you want to apply your newly acquired knowledge to help others?
- How can TFC help you spread the message of foot health and help others?
- How do you want to contribute to your community as a health leader?





1 ------- WRITING YOUR STORY

Each week for the past 11 weeks has been like a chapter in a story

The story of your journey to spend 1 hour a day learning how to upgrade your foot health and how to help others do the same

You likely experienced high points, low points, overcame challenges and had some great wins


Writing your story:
1) write a short story with you as the main character (see 360 share your story notes)
2) Write a memoire of your journey (Brendan's posted as an example?)



2 ------- GRADUATION CALL

Your FNT graduation call is on Monday May 1 from 5-615pm ET

It's a chance for everyone to celebrate their epic accomplishment as a group and to share your experience

Each Nerd will have 5 minutes to share with the group. Please answer these 4 questions in your 5 minutes:

- What did you get out of Foot Nerd Training?
- What are you going to do with your new knowledge?
- What did you learn about yourself?
- How are you going to celeberate to imprint and acknowledge your achievement?


3 ------- FINAL SCREENS

Screen your squat and your balance (same as you did in week 1 and week 6), capture them on video and upload them to your google drive folder

Review the videos in your google drive folder and compare your squat and balance at week 12 to how they were at weeks 1 and 6



4 ------- TFC AFFILIATE

A way to make income recommending helpful tools to others



5 ------- CELEBRATION

Celebrating your accomplishment

Meaning is created by us. You completed a hard thing. You did the work. It's a major accomplishment. Treat it like a major accomplishment

How will you celebrate? With who? It can be big or small, subtle or extravagant




6 ------- WHAT NOW?

(what will you do with your new knowledge and understanding? Joining Kajabi, making it to basecamp, events - SoleMate sessions, SOS


Now that you have acquired Foot Nerd level understanding, what will you do with it?

How will you transmit it to others?

How will you continue your learning journey?

Take this opportunity to get clear on your future aspirations and write a plan for what you want to achieve in the next 1,6 & 12 months

Do you want to continue leading events? When will you schedule your next one?

What area of the body or movement ability do you want to focus on next?

What habits/routines do you plan to integrate into your lifestyle in order to continue making progress on your health journey?

Completing Foot Nerd training marks an initiation into an aligned community of health leaders but it's not the end of your learning

We hope that you have gained a deeper understanding and useful tools over the past 11 weeks that will serve you well as you continue your Nerd journey

Whether you wish to continue leading events, make it to Basecamp or become a TFC Guide, TFC is here to support you



7 ------- TFC GUIDE TRAINING

Explain it, how it will be different, when it's launching

Why,How,What



8 ------- BECOMING A WORLD CLASS FOOT HEALTH AUTHORITY

** section was inspired by a chapter titled “top dog” in Beyond Order by Jordan Peterson **


Until recently, I very much disliked the term "expert"

Most of the "experts" I've met to date have far too much certainty that they know everything there is to know on their respective topic

That certainty made them rigid in their thinking and inflexible to changing their mind

These individuals had often accumuated a lot of time in academia reading papers and books but few had much if any experiential knowledge to speak from

These experts seemed to have derived their confidence from letters next to their name, not from demonstrating competence that could be put to the test

In his book "Beyond Order", Jordan Peterson elaborates on the concept of what it means to be an authority on a subjet

In particular, he talks about how it’s a good thing to be an authority

He mentions that life is difficult and suffering is common. Ameliorating that suffering takes initiative, effort and ability

True authority is derived from ability and competence

False authority is derived from degrees which seem to have lost their validity as proxies of ability because of the outdated methods that conventional 
education continues to employ

A few potent quotes from the book:

“If a problem is real, then the people who are best at solving the problem at hand should rise to the top. That is not power. That is the authority 
that properly accompanies ability”

“A responsible person decides to make a problem his/her problem and then works diligently towards its solution with other people in the most efficient 
manner possible”


My primary takewaways from his work:

Authority is earned through competence

It must be wielded honourably

Our ambition must be derived from a desire to solve genuine, serious problems

Authority is derived from competence

An authority is an expert on a subject. A group of people with official responsibility for a particular area of activity 



Foot Nerds are authorities in the realm of foot health

In short, Foot Nerd training aims to develop world class authorities via proof or work

Authorities that have the ability to effectively help others restore healthy feet because they have first done the work themselves


In the past 12 weeks you have become a proof of work foot health authority. Not because we say so, because you have done the work

Why am I writing all of this? Because I want you to appreciate the value of the understanding you have gained in these 12 weeks

By grasping the value of our understanding and the effectiveness with which it solves an important problem (foot dysfunction), we gain the confidence that
enables us to teach others


---------------------


CONGRATULATIONS

Finishing Foot Nerd Training is a major feat. It's an intense commitment and proof of work that you showed up and did you what said you were going to do

You are now part of a global family of health leaders. We discuss, disagree and work together to determine truth

We support each other during hard times and celebrate our achievements together

Thank you for being part of the Nerd Herd. Thank you for being a health leader in your community

Thank you for helping to improve the world one sole at a time and one step at a time

Love you all

Nick
