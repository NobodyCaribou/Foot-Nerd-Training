Welcome to week 12 of Foot Nerd training and congratulations on making it here

The focus this week is reflection and integration. The objective is to debreif yourself from the past 11 weeks to extract wisdom from your journey

De-brief defined: To question yourself systematically in order to obtain useful intelligence or information

The past 11 weeks have been busy. Many experiments, many experiences, and hopefully lots of notes

Now it's time to review your notes, reflect on the experiences, and ask yourself some questions:

- What were the most memorable moments?
- What were the toughest challenges?
- What results did you achieve?
- What are the most impactful lessons learned?
- What are your most powerful insights about restoring foot health?
- How do you want to apply your newly acquired knowledge to help others?
- How can TFC help you spread the message of foot health and help others?
- How do you want to contribute to your community as a health leader?

We cover:

1) Reviewing your proof of work
2) Becoming a world class foot health authority
3) Your next steps
4) CONGRATULATIONS!!!



1 ------- REVIEWING YOUR PROOF OF WORK

Review each of your google drive folder submissions. Witness your progress

Your event relfection paper is an opportunity to process your teaching experience. Here are some questions you might want to think about and answer:

- Overall, how was the experience? (challenging? satisfying? positive?)
- What did you learn about yourself during the process of preparing and delivering the event?
- What challenges did you face? How did you overcome them?
- Did the experience meet your expectations? Exceed them? Fall short of them?
- Do you intend to continue organizing and teaching events? If so, what will you change for the next one?
- Do you have any feedback on how FNT could have better prepared you to lead your event?



2 ------- BECOMING A WORLD CLASS FOOT HEALTH AUTHORITY

** section was inspired by a chapter titled “top dog” in Beyond Order by Jordan Peterson **


Until recently, I very much disliked the term "expert"

Most of the "experts" I've met to date have far too much certainty that they know everything there is to know on their respective topic

That certainty made them rigid in their thinking and inflexible to changing their mind

These individuals had often accumuated a lot of time in academia reading papers and books but few had much if any experiential knowledge to speak from

These experts seemed to have derived their confidence from letters next to their name, not from demonstrating competence that could be put to the test

In his book "Beyond Order", Jordan Peterson elaborates on the concept of what it means to be an authority on a subjet

In particular, he talks about how it’s a good thing to be an authority

He mentions that life is difficult and suffering is common. Ameliorating that suffering takes initiative, effort and ability

True authority is derived from ability and competence

False authority is derived from degrees which seem to have lost their validity as proxies of ability because of the outdated methods that conventional 
education continues to employ

A few potent quotes from the book:

“If a problem is real, then the people who are best at solving the problem at hand should rise to the top. That is not power. That is the authority 
that properly accompanies ability”

“A responsible person decides to make a problem his/her problem and then works diligently towards its solution with other people in the most efficient 
manner possible”


My primary takewaways from his work:

Authority is earned through competence

It must be wielded honourably

Our ambition must be derived from a desire to solve genuine, serious problems

Authority is derived from competence

An authority is an expert on a subject. A group of people with official responsibility for a particular area of activity 



Foot Nerds are authorities in the realm of foot health

In short, Foot Nerd training aims to develop world class authorities via proof or work

Authorities that have the ability to effectively help others restore healthy feet because they have first done the work themselves


In the past 12 weeks you have become a proof of work foot health authority. Not because we say so, because you have done the work

Why am I writing all of this? Because I want you to appreciate the value of the understanding you have gained in these 12 weeks

By grasping the value of our understanding and the effectiveness with which it solves an important problem (foot dysfunction), we gain the confidence that
enables us to teach others



3 ------- YOUR NEXT STEPS

Now that you have acquired Foot Nerd level understanding, what will you do with it?

How will you transmit it to others?

How will you continue your learning journey?

Take this opportunity to get clear on your future aspirations and write a plan for what you want to achieve in the next 1,6 & 12 months

Do you want to continue teaching workshops? When will you schedule your next one?

What area of the body or movement ability do you want to focus on next?

What habits/routines do you plan to integrate into your lifestyle in order to continue making progress on your health journey?

Completing Foot Nerd training marks an initiation into an aligned community of health leaders but it's not the end of your learning

We hope that you have gained a deeper understanding and useful tools over the past 11 weeks that will serve you well as you continue your Nerd journey

Whether you wish to continue teaching workshops, contribute content to FNT or simply remain connected on Slack, TFC is here to support you

As a Nerd, you have lifetime access to FNT as we continue to improve an evolve it

If you wish to begin your 12 weeks again, you are welcome to renew your training anytime 

New groups begin the first day of every month. To enroll yourself, simply email Ruth at nerdhelperteam@gmail.com and she will help you get started
