? ------- BECOMING A WORLD CLASS FOOT HEALTH AUTHORITY

** section was inspired by a chapter titled “top dog” in Beyond Order by Jordan Peterson **


Until recently, I very much disliked the term "expert"

Most of the "experts" I've met to date had far too much certainty that they knew everything there was to know on their respective topic

That certainty made them rigid in their thinking and inflexible to changing their mind

These individuals had often accumuated a lot of time in academia reading papers and books but few had much if any experiential knowledge to speak from

These experts seemed to have derived their confidence from letters next to their name, not from demonstrating competence that could be put to the test

In his book "Beyond Order", Jordan Peterson elaborates on the concept of what it means to be an authority on a subjet

In particular, he talks about how it’s a good thing to be an authority

Life is difficult and suffering is common. Ameliorating that suffering takes initiative, effort and ability

True authority is derived from ability and competence

False authority is derived from degrees which seem to have lost their validity as proxies of ability because of the outdated methods that conventional 
education continues to use. 

A few potent quotes from the book:

“If a problem is real, then the people who are best at solving the problem at hand should rise to the top. That is not power. That is the authority 
that properly accompanies ability”

“A responsible person decides to make a problem his/her problem and then works diligently towards its solution with other people in the most efficient 
manner possible”


My primary takewaways from his work:

Authority is earned through competence

It must be wielded honourably

Our ambition must be derived from a desire to solve genuine, serious problems

Authority is derived from competence

An authority is an expert on a subject. A group of people with official responsibility for a particular area of activity 



Foot Nerds are authorities in the realm of foot health

In short, foot nerd training aims to develop world class authorities via proof or work

Authorities that have the ability to effectively help others restore healthy feet because they have first done the work themselves


In 12 weeks you will become a proof of work foot health authority. Not because we say so, because you have done the work

What am I writing all of this? Because I want you to appreciate the value of the understanding you will gain during the next 12 weeks

By grasping the value of our understanding and the effectiveness with which it solves an important problem (foot dysfunction), we gain the confidence that
enables us to teach others



? ------- WRITING YOUR FOOT NERD DIRECTORY BIO

As a way to recognize each foot nerd that has completed training, we will be creating a global directory of foot nerds at www.tfcFootNerd.com

This directory will also be used by members of the global TFC family to find foot nerds who can help them

This is your first impression to the world and how you find the people you want to work with

Please submit your bio in the #week12 channel on slack so we can upload it to the website
