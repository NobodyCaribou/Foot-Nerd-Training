3) Visualization
4) Controlling the controllables
5) Being adaptable
6) Leading by example

9) Story: my first workshop

This week should be spent refining and practicing your delivery

Begin with creating a general outline of the session you are planning to lead

Go into the #week9 channel on slack and share your outline with fellow nerds

Seek support from other nerds who have come before you and learn from their event experiences

The more ideas we put out into the open on slack, the more material there will be for future nerds to learn from and be inspired by



** A note from Nick **

Do not underestimate the positive impact you can have on the lives of people who attend your event

I've led many events since the beginning of TFC and am always struck by how powerful experiences can be on peoples health mindset

Feet are where we start but it's not where the impact of our work ends

Help someone understand the process of restoring healthy feet and you've given them a framework that can then apply to restoring 6 pillar health

You are inspiring people to restore a strong foundation for health

This is important work

Thank you for taking on this challenge and devoting time and energy into the process of becoming in impactful health leader



1 ------- PLANNING

Planning is all about clear details and great communication

The result of good planning: confidence that the experience you've created offers value, clarity of what you are offering

Being clear on why and what you are doing allows you to tell people about it with an authentic confidence that it will help them

Creating a plan is like drawing a map. You start with choosing where you want to go and then you plan out the steps needed to get there

Decision: I want to do X

Plan: In order to get to X, these are the steps I need to take within this specific timeline in order to succeed

Details:
- Finalizing your flowsheet/manual (if you are preparing one) and having enough copies printed in time for the workshop
- Ordering equipment (solemates, beams, toe spreaders, cork balls) with enough time to allow delivery before your workshop

Note: although a clear plan is important, flexibility allows you to be adaptable to change

Relationship with host:
- Being respectful of their space
- Offering them value (free spots for members, discounted rate for members, facility rental payment)
- Knowing where the bathrooms are
- Rules re: foot & drink in the facility

Key ingredients to a great experience:

- Energetic, enthusiastic, confident and well prepared leader
- Simple, potent, engaging content that is practical and can be immediately applied
- Fun, memorable games
- Curious, happy, keen participants
- Open space in a quiet facility kept at a reasonable temperature (I've done some super sweaty sessions and they can be tough)
- Good music (this makes a huge difference in my opinion)



2 ------- PRACTICE

Getting good at anything requires practice

Becoming world class at something requires consistent, long term practice with a mindset of mastery. Borderline obsession

In the context of teaching, practice means knowing your material and having a body capable of demonstrating full human foundational capacity 

Use your daily life as an outlet to practice. Walk around barefoot and practice explaining to people why you do it if they ask questions

Find excuses to talk about feet, footwear, balance and health with your family, friends and coworkers

Practice explaining the 4F's of footwear in different ways (to a 5 year old, a 13 year old, to your mother, to your grandmother)

Practice your explanations in the mirror, while out on a walk (put headphones in so you don't look like a crazy person), or by creating free content

Spitting off facts requires memorization. Explaining a concept in 5 different ways requires understanding

Avoid memorization, practice understanding

Create a flowsheet or cue cards and do a mock workshop

Teaching is like taking an exam. The more you prepare, the more confident you become and the less nervous you are 

Create a practice schedule. Set aside 30 minutes a day for the next two weeks to refine, practice and master the experience you will deliver next week



3 ------- VISUALIZATION

Lie down on the ground and visualize your event

The conversations you might have. The first 2 minutes of your introduction. The flow of the day. The questions participants might ask

Imagine what leading an amazing experience looks like and feels like

Mentally rehearse sections of your delivery on a walk

For those new to the practice of visualization, it might sound/feel silly. That's okay. It was for me as well

From personal experience, I've found visualization to be a powerful tool when it comes to preparing and practicing my delivery of events



4 ------- CONTROLLING THE CONTROLLABLES

The serenity prayer contains a lot of wisdom. It goes something like this:

"Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference"

Controlling the controllables is all about focusing on the things you have control over. Things like:

- The quality of sleep you get the night before teaching
- Having a clear mind to focus on your session
- Planning your session in detail
- Practicing the material and your delivery
- Setting a good example when demonstrating screens (proof of work)
- Having written materials and equipment ready on the day of your event (if applicable)
- Not overthinking or worrying about things that haven't happened yet (and usually don't end up happening)

Things you can't control:
- A power outage
- The facility owner running late
- Your child getting sick the day before the workshop
- People forgetting to show up

Control the controllables. Your inputs, your energy, your work. Focus your energy on the things you are in control of

Adapt to the circumstances you don't control and always make the best of every situation



5 ------- BEING ADAPTABLE

Being adaptable starts with accepting an element of uncertainty in everything you do

In the context of leading an event, mitigating uncertainty involves creating contingency plans and flowing with whatever challenges come up

Words of advice:

Focus on delivering a great experience, even if that experience doesn't end up being exactly what you planned

Make the best of every situation that arises and keep a positive mindset

Adapt your delivery to the people in your session. If something doesn't go to plan, flow with it. Don't get rattled

The obstacles we face end up guiding us to the best possible outcomes. Remember that



6 ------- LEADING BY EXAMPLE

"Showing is better than telling" - Timothy Gallwey, author of The Inner Game of Tennis

Your authority as a teacher comes from your understanding and your proof of work (your foot health)

Part of being a competent teacher is consistently practicing what you teach

In order to authentically communicate the beneits of natural footwear, ground living and balance, you must have experienced those benefits yourself

Share stories of where you started, how you got to where you currently are, and how you maintain functional capacity through your lifestyle

As a teacher and foot nerd, youre expected to be able to demonstrate foundational capacity on screens (or be actively working towards that capacity)

Your daily effort to restore healthy feet is what teaches you the lessons you are now passing onto others

Note: people learn much more from the behaviours they watch us do than the words they hear us say



7 ------- CREATING YOUR CHECKLIST

A checklist is a written tool that helps reduce the memory burden of remembering everything you need to do

It helps ensure consistency when carrying out a task and reduces the risk of forgetting something or making an error

Your checklist is an evolving document. It begins very simple and is added to, moulded and evolved with every experience you lead

Recommendation: begin with a single sheet of paper (your master checklist) and divide it into three sections: 

1) Lead up (things to be done before your workshop)
2) Day of (things to be done on the day of your workshop)
3) Day after (things to be done on the day after your workshop)

Here are a few samples of items that might be on your master checklist:

-> Lead up
- Mock practice of session intro (first 5 min)
- Review material the night before
- Print or write up a registration list that includes names of everyone who paid so you can mark them off as they arrive
- Reminder email sent to participants 1-2 days prior to session which includes information like:

When to arrive
What to do on arrival
Facility rules
Tools/equipment for sale & how to pay for them
Bringing water
Wearing clothing that permits full functional movement
Bring a pen to take notes (and a notebook if no flowsheet/manual is given to participants)
Be ready to be barefoot
Bring good questions
Bring a smile and an open mind ready to play

- Handouts printed
- Music playlist created
- Details confirmed with host
- Equipment & tools ordered with a safety buffer of time to ensure they arrive on time
- Good PM routine night before your session to ensure a good sleep

-> Day of event
- Calm, focused morning
- Well hydrated
- Pack up handouts, water bottle, snack, registration list, equipment/tools 
- Leave early to ensure you arrive 15min early to speak with host
- Ask participants for consent to take pictures

-> Day after event
- Written reflection of the experience (what went well, challenges faced, things to improve for next time)
- Update checklist for next time if new items should be added
- Follow up email to participants and host (thanking them, sending resources, seeking feedback)



8 ------- HAVING FUN

If you're having fun leading your event, it's likely that the people you're teaching will also have fun

Leading an event is hard work but on the day of the session, smiling and enjoying yourself is really important

You've spent the time creating an awesome offering, have practiced your delivery, now it's time to enjoy the session



9 ------- STORY: MY FIRST WORKSHOP

In order to overcome the challenges of teaching, we must have a powerful desire to offer value to others and to grow personally

A desire to be an inspiration for the people we teach

A desire to become an effective leader able to guide people towards resources and tools that help them do what they want to do

I put a lot of work into my first workshop

When I think back on that session, I can't help but admit that it wasn't very good compared to my current abilities

That said, at the time it seemend like a captivating and useful session that would help get people on the path to healthier feet

It was the best I knew at the time and I took pride in the effort expended to create the topic flow, print out booklets, practice my talking points, and
the consistent effort put into reviewing and sharpening the material which helped me build confidence needed to deliver the material effectively

Despite the peparation and energy put into the workshop, my first one rough

I was nervous, I was stressed, things didn't go to plan, I didn't cover everything I wanted to and I was doubting myself

I was hard on myself because I cared

Because I wanted to deliver a really awesome experience and the workshop didn't feel like it was meeting my expectations

Despite my criticims, I was pleasantly surprised when participants told me how much they enjoyed the session and how many new useful things they learned

Moral of the story: Growth doesn't come from doing easy things you feel qualified to do. It comes from doing hard things that push your limits

A great workshop results from hard work

It's the result of giving your best effort, deeply understanding and having conviction in the information you're sharing and enjoying the process of 
growing as a person by doing scary things that push you to get better

I hope this story inspires you and gives you the confidence to share the story of your first workshop experience with other nerds
