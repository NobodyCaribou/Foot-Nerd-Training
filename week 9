In week 9 we're continuing to focus on event training. Topics we cover:

1) Planning
2) Practice
3) Visualization
4) Story: my first workshop

This week should be spent refining and practicing your delivery

Begin with creating a general outline of the session you are planning to lead

Go into the #week9 channel on slack and share your outline with fellow nerds

Seek support from other nerds who have come before you and learn from their event experiences

The more ideas we put out into the open on slack, the more material there will be for future nerds to learn from and be inspired by



** A note from Nick **

Do not underestimate the positive impact you can have on the lives of people who attend your event

I've led many events since the beginning of TFC and am always struck by how powerful experiences can be on peoples health mindset

Feet are where we start but it's not where the impact of our work ends

Help someone understand the process of restoring healthy feet and you've given them a framework that can then apply to restoring 6 pillar health

You are inspiring people to restore a strong foundation for health

This is important work

Thank you for taking on this challenge and devoting time and energy into the process of becoming in impactful health leader



1 ------- PLANNING

Planning is all about clear details and great communication

The result of good planning: confidence that the experience you've created offers value, clarity of what you are offering

Being clear on why and what you are doing allows you to tell people about it with an authentic confidence that it will help them

Creating a plan is like drawing a map. You start with choosing where you want to go and then you plan out the steps needed to get there

Decision: I want to do X

Plan: In order to get to X, these are the steps I need to take within this specific timeline in order to succeed

Details:
- Finalizing your flowsheet/manual (if you are preparing one) and having enough copies printed in time for the workshop
- Ordering equipment (solemates, beams, toe spreaders, cork balls) with enough time to allow delivery before your workshop

Note: although a clear plan is important, flexibility allows you to be adaptable to change

Relationship with host:
- Being respectful of their space
- Offering them value (free spots for members, discounted rate for members, facility rental payment)
- Knowing where the bathrooms are
- Rules re: foot & drink in the facility

Key ingredients to a great experience:

- Energetic, enthusiastic, confident and well prepared leader
- Simple, potent, engaging content that is practical and can be immediately applied
- Fun, memorable games
- Curious, happy, keen participants
- Open space in a quiet facility kept at a reasonable temperature (I've done some super sweaty sessions and they can be tough)
- Good music (this makes a huge difference in my opinion)



2 ------- PRACTICE

Getting good at anything requires practice

Becoming world class at something requires consistent, long term practice with a mindset of mastery. Borderline obsession

In the context of teaching, practice means knowing your material and having a body capable of demonstrating full human foundational capacity 

Use your daily life as an outlet to practice. Walk around barefoot and practice explaining to people why you do it if they ask questions

Find excuses to talk about feet, footwear, balance and health with your family, friends and coworkers

Practice explaining the 4F's of footwear in different ways (to a 5 year old, a 13 year old, to your mother, to your grandmother)

Practice your explanations in the mirror, while out on a walk (put headphones in so you don't look like a crazy person), or by creating free content

Spitting off facts requires memorization. Explaining a concept in 5 different ways requires understanding

Avoid memorization, practice understanding

Create a flowsheet or cue cards and do a mock workshop

Teaching is like taking an exam. The more you prepare, the more confident you become and the less nervous you are 

Create a practice schedule. Set aside 30 minutes a day for the next two weeks to refine, practice and master the experience you will deliver next week



3 ------- VISUALIZATION

Lie down on the ground and visualize your event

The conversations you might have. The first 2 minutes of your introduction. The flow of the day. The questions participants might ask

Imagine what leading an amazing experience looks like and feels like

Mentally rehearse sections of your delivery on a walk

For those new to the practice of visualization, it might sound/feel silly. That's okay. It was for me as well

From personal experience, I've found visualization to be a powerful tool when it comes to preparing and practicing my delivery of events



4 ------- STORY: MY FIRST WORKSHOP

In order to overcome the challenges of teaching, we must have a powerful desire to offer value to others and to grow personally

A desire to be an inspiration for the people we teach

A desire to become an effective leader able to guide people towards resources and tools that help them do what they want to do

I put a lot of work into my first workshop

When I think back on that session, I can't help but admit that it wasn't very good compared to my current abilities

That said, at the time it seemend like a captivating and useful session that would help get people on the path to healthier feet

It was the best I knew at the time and I took pride in the effort expended to create the topic flow, print out booklets, practice my talking points, and
the consistent effort put into reviewing and sharpening the material which helped me build confidence needed to deliver the material effectively

Despite the peparation and energy put into the workshop, my first one rough

I was nervous, I was stressed, things didn't go to plan, I didn't cover everything I wanted to and I was doubting myself

I was hard on myself because I cared

Because I wanted to deliver a really awesome experience and the workshop didn't feel like it was meeting my expectations

Despite my criticims, I was pleasantly surprised when participants told me how much they enjoyed the session and how many new useful things they learned

Moral of the story: Growth doesn't come from doing easy things you feel qualified to do. It comes from doing hard things that push your limits

A great workshop results from hard work

It's the result of giving your best effort, deeply understanding and having conviction in the information you're sharing and enjoying the process of 
growing as a person by doing scary things that push you to get better

I hope this story inspires you and gives you the confidence to share the story of your first workshop experience with other nerds
