[Work in progress. Completion deadline: 8.21.22]

Welcome to week 9 of foot nerd training. In your second week of workshop training we cover:

1) Planning
2) Practice
3) Visualization



1 ------- PLANNING

Planning is all about details and great communication

Knowing that the experience you've created offers value and telling people about it with an authentic confidence that it will help them

Creating a plan is like drawing a map. You start with choosing where you want to go and then you plan out the steps needed to get there

Decision: I want to do X

Plan: In order to get to X, these are the steps I need to take within this specific timeline in order to succeed

Details:
- Finalizing your flowsheet/manual and having enough copies printed in time for the workshop
- Ordering equipment (solemates, beams, toe spreaders, cork balls) with enough time to allow delivery before your workshop

Plans must always be adaptable to change

Relationship with host:
- Being respectful of their space
- Offering them value (free spots for members, discounted rate for members, facility rental payment)
- Knowing where the bathrooms are
- Food rules


Key ingredients to a great experience:

- Energetic, enthusiastic leader
- Simple, potent, engaging content 
- Fun, memorable games
- Curious, happy, keen participants
- Open space in a quiet facility kept at a reasonable temperature (I've done some super sweaty sessions and they can be tough)
- Good music

2 ------- PRACTICE

Getting good at something requires practice

Becoming world class at something requires consistent, long term practice with a mindset of mastery. Borderline obsession

In the context of teaching workshops, practice means knowing your material, having a body capable of demonstrating full capacity 

Use your daily life as an outlet to practice. Walk around barefoot and practice explaining to people why you do it if they ask questions

Find excuses to talk about feet, footwear, balance, health with your family, friends and coworkers

Practice explaining the 4F's in different ways (to a 5 year old, a 13 year old, to your mother, to your grandmother)

Practice your explanations in the mirror, while out on a walk (put headphones in so you don't look like a crazy person), or by creating content

Spitting off facts requires memorization

Explaining a concept in 5 different ways requires understanding

Avoid memorization, practice understanding

Create a flowsheet or cue cards and do a mock workshop 

Teaching is like taking an exam. The more you prepare, the more confident you become and the less nervous you are 



3 ------- VISUALIZATION

Lie down on the ground and visualize your workshop

The conversations you might have. The first 2 minutes of your introduction. The flow of the day. The questions you might be faced with

Imagine what giving an amazing workshop looks like and feels like

Mentally rehearse your delivery on a walk
