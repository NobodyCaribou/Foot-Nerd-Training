The Golden Rules

Simple keeps us accountable
Complex distracts us

My 5 most potent heuristics for restoring healthy feet:

1) Wear natural footwear (for best results, work towards progressively eliminating unnatural footwear - cycle them out, go faster for faster results)
2) Become capable of getting into a resting squat position for 2 minutes comfortably. If you can't, work towards it everyday until you can
3) Become capable of standing on 1 foot barefoot with your eyes closed for 60 seconds without making an error. If you cant, work on it until you can
4) Sit in chairs for 4 hours or less perday and if sitting in a chair, get up and moveevery 30 minutes
5) Adopt a long term mindset. It's not a race. A little bit better everyday is the objective. Be patient. Trust the process and show up everyday
