Welcome to week 4 of foot nerd training

We hope week 3 was filled with new experiences, playful learning and that you took plenty of detailed notes

To keep in context on Slack, please engage in the "#week4" channel to share stories, seek help or learn from other foot nerds

Reflection questions:

- Did I spend a daily hour restoring foot health for all 7 days? If not, why not?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?
- Did I check in with foot nerds on Slack?

Task: set a clear objective to accomplish in week 4 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

In week 4 we cover: 

1) Hips
2) Ground living
3) Training
4) Tools



1 ------- HIPS

--

Our lower half (belly button and below) is a deeply integrated subsystem within the human body

That means that feet, ankles, knees and hips function as interdependent elements within a system that cannot be optimized by isolating the parts

Our hips are an especially important area. Hips are the primary stabilizers of the legs, the master joint in terms of alignment, and also the primary
engines for force production and propulsion

Our modern culture of chair sitting has negatively impacted our lower body function in a big way and this has consequences on other lower systems,
especially our feet

A quote from the great Charlie Weingroff explains why in order to resolve foot issues, we need to look upstream to our hips:

"I've never seen a foot a hip couldn't fix"

Practice: 
- Explain and write down the connection between hips and feet in simple terms that a 10 year old could understand
- Choose a hip experiment and do it everday for the next 7 days. Write notes and log data everyday

Experiment: half lotus                    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQtrEOym-zg

2 ------- GROUND LIVING

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAtnVtEEPYI

Practice: 
- Chair sitting audit. Record the amount of time you spend sitting in chairs each day for the next 7 days

Experiment: un-chair your life        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6Z1_9GHyLs



3 ------- TRAINING

video: (attention training)           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvORZNY0e9U

Practice: Choose a training experiment for this week (mobility, strength, capacity)

Examples: 
- Train hip extension and rotation mobility everyday for 10 minutes
- Train squat strength by doing 3 sets of 10 loaded squats everyday this week



4 ------- TOOLS

Practice:
- Make your own balance beam and spend 5 minutes a day this week training your balance (record your max single leg time for both sides on day 1 and day 7)
- Explain why footwear is our most powerful physical tool for restoring natural foot health
