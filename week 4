Welcome to week 4 of Foot Nerd Training

To keep in context on Slack, please add yourself to #week4 channel

We hope week 3 went smooth and you have been able to make good on your commitment to spend 1 focused hour everyday on your foot health
 
Complete these things everyday: 

1) Daily practice (12-30 min)
2) Take a note (5-10 min)
3) Study a concept and practice explaining it (5-10 min)

Tasks/dates this week:

-> On Feb 28 (last day of week 4), set aside 30 minutes to review your notes from the past 6 days and extract a golden nugget

-> Set a clear objective to accomplish in week 4 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

----

In week 4 we cover: 

1) Balance (core concept #7)
2) Resting squat position (core concept #8)
3) Training
4) Tools



1 ------- BALANCE

Why is balance important?

How do we improve our balance?

What is balance?



Balance is one of our 5 keys to foot freedom

Gaining the ability to balance on 1 leg barefoot on flat ground for 60 seconds with your eyes closed is a powerful standard to reach

That capability mitigates your risk of injury in a major way and also indicates foundational capacity at your feet and hips


Within the context of our physical bodies, balance is our ability to maintain our center of mass over our base of support in order to avoid falling

Our ability to balance requires the interplay of 3 systems: 1) Proprioceptive system, 2) Visual system, 3) Vestibular system


Proprioception is the signals our bodies receive from joints, muscles, and tendons. It's our body's system of built in position sensors

Our visual system uses our eyes to transmit position information

Our vestibular system uses a series of canals in the inner ear to transmit position information


Based on signals received from those 3 systems, our bodies will fire the correct muscles at the appropriate intensity in order to stop us from falling

As bipedal organisms that walk upright, balance is very important for humans

In order to do something as simple as walk, we need to be able to balance on 1 leg effectively

Without the ability to balance, we're essentially stuck lying down on the ground or crawling around


Balance is our ability to effectively respond to external challenges like gravity, uneven surfaces, or external forces

The more optimally we can respond to challenge, the lower our risk of injury

Better balance = mitigation of injury risk and increased ability to effectively respond to external challenges we face

Feet are the foundation for our balance. They are importangt sensors that transmit information to our brains about the ground below us

Imporant sensors must be protected from damage but they should never be impaired

Natural footwear protects our feet from damage while allowing as much sensory input as possible (like wearing sunglasses to protect our eyes)

Unnatural footwear might protect our feet from physical damage but they also impact sensory input (like wearing a blindfold)

Wearing natural footwear immediately improves our balance compared to wearing shoes with foam or air bubbles under them

In a world of distractions, focus is a superpower

Balance training is 2 things: 1) focus training, 2) lower body recalibration

Training our focus is a means of training our minds to settle and direct our attention to a single task

The ability to focus is key to our ability to learn, listen, and engage in deep work


Developing balance is really just improving lower body calibration. A calibrated lower body performs well and is resilient to injury

The ability to successfully and efficiently fight gravity is an astounding capability of the human body


Balance training is high throughput problem solving by the body

--> Input: balance challenge

--> Output: the body naturally discovers the most efficient way to organize itself against gravity and avoid falling over

Time training balance is time debugging our lower body system


By seeking efficiency, our bodies activate our hip rotator cuff

The fine precision, reflexively activated muscles that keep the ball safely centered in the socket just like the shoulder 

I realized in clinic how much information I can get by screening someone’s single leg balance

I could see how their entire system reacted when stress tested with gravity and especially when the visual field is eliminated (eyes closed)

I also realized how many people had poor balance and how big of an obstacle poor balance was to restoring natural movement

** A note on flailing (defined: the act of waving or swinging wildly) **

Flailing is exploration. It’s your body trying a new experiment: throw a limb here and see if it helps

Your body is drawing a map of the different muscles to fire when faced with a certain problem (not falling over)

The more flailing the better. Embrace it. It’s a good thing


How the balance beam started:

As an experiment in clinic, I brought in a piece of metal tubing and challenged patients to balance on it as a way to assess how they reacted

The beam was an honest screen (people couldn’t cheat it) and patients found it to be a fun tool to play on

They actually enjoyed training their balance and balance improvements had huge trickle effects on movement patterns and positioning


Lack of movement and lots of chair sitting develops dark spots in the google maps version of our motor cortex

Those dark spots are unsafe to our bodies. They don't know how to stabilize there. It's where injuries happen. It's where mobility is usually reduced

Balance training is like repopulating Google maps of the motor cortex


A core requirement of Foot Nerd Training is a daily balance practice. 10 minutes everyday playing and working to develop excellent balance

How do you know you have reached a high standard of proficiency with your balance? Screen your balance. Work on it daily until you can ace the test

TEST: SL balance screen. 3/3 attempts successful in a row (barefoot, hard ground, eyes closed, single leg)

--

Balance training is not only a physical training tool, it's also a mental training tool

Like meditation, it trains our mind to focus on a single task: not falling over

Time spent sitting in chairs creates imbalances around our hip joint and unplugs the important deep stabilizers that enable glute function

Relcaiming use of our glutes begins with plugging in those deep hip muscles and re-training our hips to act like hips again

Practice: Spend time this week mastering the movements below on your SoleMate

2 ------- RESTING SQUAT POSITION

Why is the resting squat position important?

How do we improve our resting squat?

What does a functional resting squat look like?

Our lower half (belly button and below) is a deeply integrated subsystem within the human body

That means that feet, ankles, knees and hips function as interdependent elements within a system that cannot be optimized by isolating the parts

Our hips are an especially important area. Hips are the primary stabilizers of the legs, the master joint in terms of alignment, and also the primary
engines for force production and propulsion

Our modern culture of chair sitting has negatively impacted our lower body function in a big way and this has consequences on other lower systems,
especially our feet

A quote from the great Charlie Weingroff explains why in order to resolve foot issues, we need to look upstream to our hips:

"I've never seen a foot a hip couldn't fix"

Practice: 
- Explain and write down the connection between hips and feet in simple terms that a 10 year old could understand



3 ------- TRAINING

Practice: Choose a training experiment for this week (mobility, strength, capacity)

Examples: 
- Train hip extension and rotation mobility everyday for 10 minutes
- Train squat strength by doing 3 sets of 10 loaded squats everyday this week



4 ------- TOOLS

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA-mYfTfOL4

Practice:
- Explain why footwear is our most powerful physical tool for restoring natural foot health
