Welcome to week 4 of Foot Nerd Training

To keep in context on Slack, please add yourself to #week4 channel

We hope week 3 went smooth and you have been able to make good on your commitment to spend 1 focused hour everyday on your foot health
 
Complete these things everyday: 

1) Daily practice (12-30 min)
2) Take a note (5-10 min)
3) Study a concept and practice explaining it (5-10 min)

Tasks/dates this week:

-> On Feb 28 (last day of week 4), set aside 30 minutes to review your notes from the past 6 days and extract a golden nugget

-> Set a clear objective to accomplish in week 4 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

----

In week 4 we cover: 

1) Balance (core concept #7)
2) Resting squat position (core concept #8)
3) Training
4) Tools



1 ------- BALANCE

Balance can have many different definitions depending on context. For our purposes, we will keep in context of the physical body

Balance is the ability to respond effectively to external challenges

Specifically, physical balance is the ability to keep our center of mass within our base of support when fighting gravity and dealing with uneven terrain

Better balance means better ability to protect ourselves from falling or getting injured

As humans, balance is a foundational skill for all bipedal movements

Even something as simple as walking requires us to have the ability to balance on 1 leg. Without that ability, walking is impossible


Balance is an important checkpoint on the way to basecamp. The ability to balance requires:
- Our feet to act as effective sensors
- Our feet and hips to speak to each other
- Access to key muscles at the hip in order to fine tune our position to maintain stability

Think of balance as a high frequency feedback loop: 
- Proprioceptors (sensors in our skin, joints, muscles, tendons) tell our brain about the position of our body (our eyes and inner ears also help)
- Our brain processes those signals and determines the best response
- Our brain then tells which lower body muscles to fire in what intensity to correct our position

This loop happens hundreds of times per second

Better balance comes from:
- Better signals from sensors (the more we use them the better they get)
- Faster signal transmission
- Faster processing
- Access to more muscles in more positions and fine tuned ability to fire at the right intensity

Balance improves with practice regardless of your age, or current ability

It unlocks athleticism, mitigates risk of injury, and offers our body a chance to recalibrate with optimal efficiency

By training balance, we recruit our fine tuning hip stabilizers to begin working again (they often fall alseep with prolonged sitting)

Using our deep hip stabilizers instead of our major muscle groups (calves, quads, hamstrings) makes us more efficient

This efficiency helps prevent those larger muscle groups from becoming overused or developing excess tension

Natural foot health includes stable feet. Feet are the foundation for our balance and for all bipedal movement so balance is a foundational skill

Include a balance element in your daily practice everyday. Challenge yourself. Keep it playful and fun

As your balance improves, increase the challege intensity

Screen your single leg eyes closed balance and see if you can make it to 60 seconds without falling

Use the SL balance screen as a check in to see how efficient your body is stacking itself and responsing to the challenge of gravity

I often use this screen after a long flight or drive to see how well (or poorly) my body is performing and whether I can use some mobility/balance tuning

Balance training isn't only a physical training tool, it's also a mental training tool

Like meditation, it trains our mind to focus on a single task: not falling over

Our attention is now a commodity and billions of dollars are spent vying for it. The result: we often get distracted and can find it hard to focus

Time spent sitting in chairs creates imbalances around our hip joint and unplugs the important deep stabilizers that enable glute function

Relcaiming use of our glutes begins with plugging in those deep hip muscles and re-training our hips to act like hips again

Practice: Spend time this week mastering the movements below on your SoleMate

2 ------- RESTING SQUAT POSITION

Why is the resting squat position important?
- It serves as a master screen for the lower body
- It demonstrates foundational capacity at our feet, ankles and hips

How do we improve our resting squat?
- By consistently exploring the position everyday and challenging our limits

What does a functional resting squat look like?
- The ability to drop into a comfortable deep squat (hip width apart, feet parallel, heels on the ground) and take deep breaths
-

Our lower half (belly button and below) is a deeply integrated subsystem within the human body

That means that feet, ankles, knees and hips function as interdependent elements within a system that cannot be optimized by isolating the parts

Our hips are an especially important area. Hips are the primary stabilizers of the legs, the master joint in terms of alignment, and also the primary
engines for force production and propulsion

Our modern culture of chair sitting has negatively impacted our lower body function in a big way and this has consequences on other lower systems,
especially our feet

A quote from the great Charlie Weingroff explains why in order to resolve foot issues, we need to look upstream to our hips:

"I've never seen a foot a hip couldn't fix"

Practice: 
- Explain and write down the connection between hips and feet in simple terms that a 10 year old could understand



3 ------- TRAINING

Practice: Choose a training experiment for this week (mobility, strength, capacity)

Examples: 
- Train hip extension and rotation mobility everyday for 10 minutes
- Train squat strength by doing 3 sets of 10 loaded squats everyday this week



4 ------- TOOLS

Practice:
- Explain why footwear is our most powerful physical tool for restoring natural foot health
