Welcome to week 4 of Foot Nerd Training

We hope week 3 went smoothly and you recorded plenty of notes

To keep in context on Slack, please engage in the "#week4" channel to share stories, seek help or learn from other foot nerds

Reflection questions:

- Did I spend a daily hour restoring foot health for all 7 days? If not, why not?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?
- Did I check in with foot nerds on Slack?

Task: set a clear objective to accomplish in week 4 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

----

In week 4 we cover: 

1) Hips
2) Ground living
3) Training
4) Tools

1 ------- HIPS

"I've never seen a foot a hip couldn't fix"
- Charlie Weingroff

Our lower body is a deeply integrated subsystem of the body

That means that feet, ankles, knees and hips function as interdependent elements within a system that cannot be optimized by isolating the parts

Our hips are an especially important area. Hips are the primary stabilizers of the legs, the master joint in terms of alignment, and also the primary
engines for force production and propulsion

Our modern culture of chair sitting has negatively impacted our lower body function in a big way. 




Practice: 
- Explain and write down the connection between hips and feet in simple terms that a 10 year old could understand
- Choose a hip experiment and do it everday for the next 7 days. Write notes and log data everyday

2 ------- GROUND LIVING

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAtnVtEEPYI

Task: Chair sitting audit
- Record the amount of time you spend sitting in chairs each day for the next 7 days


3 ------- TRAINING

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-UOQwKis5k

Practice: Choose a training experiment for this week (mobility, strength, capacity)

Examples: 
- I'm going to train hip extension and rotation mobility everyday for 10 minutes
- I'm going to train squat strength by doing 3 sets of 10 loaded squats everyday this week

4 ------- TOOLS

Task: Make your own balance beam and spend 5 minutes a day this week training your balance

Practice: Explain how footwear is our most important physical tool for restoring natural foot health
