Welcome to week 2 of Foot Nerd Training

To keep in context on Slack, please add yourself to #week2 channel

We hope week 1 went smooth and you have been able to make good on your commitment to spend 1 focused hour everyday
on your foot health.
 
Complete these things everyday: 

1) Daily practice (12-30 min)
2) Take a note (5-10 min)
3) Study a concept and practice explaining it (5-10 min)


Reflection questions:
- Have I dedicated 1 daily uninterrupted hour to Foot Nerd Training? If no, what are the obstacles keeping me from doing that?
- Have I completed my daily practice everyday consistently. If not, what are the obstackles? 
- What kind of differences am I seeing/feeling in my body after my first 7 days?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?

In week 2 we cover: 


1) First principles [core concept #3]
2) Inputs & Outputs [core concept #4]
3) Becoming a scientist
4) Choosing experiments



1 ------- FIRST PRINCIPLES

Thinking from first principles means thinking for ourselves and starting from a foundation of what we know to be true

It means understanding fundamental truths and reasoning for ourselves from that foundation

In traditional school programs, we're taught what to remember, and not encouraged to think for ourselves

As a community of foot nerds we are all peers. We are equals and each have value to offer by sharing our experience

Truth is discovered together, disagreement is encouraged and First principles form the basis of our thinking

Thinking from first principles and embracing productive disagreement encourages a culture of critical thinking

Critical thinking is what creates our collective immunity from bias and allows us to constantly evolve and upgrade our truths

As better information presents itself (via more people sharing their unique experiences), we remain open to changing our minds

Foot nerd training is about learning through experience and thinking for yourself

Thinking like a scientist. Not assuming anything. Testng everything. No appeal to authority, only a pure quest for personal and collective truth

The 3 first principles that guide our thinking at TFC:

1) The body is a self healing system
2) The body is a self organizing system
3) The body adapts specifically to imposed demands (SAID principle)

First principles thinking applied to plantar fasciitis:

Begin by considering first principles in order to understand why the problem is happening so we can understand potential true solutions

The problem isn’t happening because of a lack of orthotics so orthotics can't be the ultimate solution

The problem is happening because the plantar fascia is being overloaded

Why is it being overloaded?

Because the foot can’t orient the bones and activate muscles support the load

Why can’t the bones or muscles support the load?

Because the hip is stiff and can’t orient the foot and because the muscles are weak from dis-use

Solution: improve hip function to improve foot position, strengthen muscles of the foot by progressively loading it

3 ------- BECOMING A SCIENTIST

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA-a9mgxVhM

Scientific method:
- Ask a good question
- Guess an answer (hypothesis)
- Design an experiment to test the answer
- Do the experiment and gather data
- Determine if the data supports or refutes your guess
- Repeat the process

Every exercise you try is an experiment. Gather data over time, analyze the data, and share your results with peers

Science is the grown up version of play. Treat the scientific process like a game to be played, not a problem to be solved

Practice:
- Explain the scientific method in simple terms. A 10 year old should be able to comprehend your explanation
- In 3 minutes or less, explain how you can use the scientific method to guide your journey to restore healthy feet
- Design two experiments for this week and outline them in your log (hypothesis, method, data collected, results)

4 ------- CHOOSING EXPERIMENTS

Choose the area you want to work on (based on your screens/what aligns most with your primary objective)

Within the context of your chosen area, experiment broadly until you find something that works (verified by screening) and that you enjoy doing

Keep doing the thing that works until it stops working

Revisit your objective and screens

Repeat the process

BEWARE of the tendency to continually search for novel experiments that distract you away from focusing on what matters most 

Be consistent, be focused and be patient
