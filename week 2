Welcome to week 2 of foot nerd training

We hope your first week went smoothly and you were able to maintain your daily hour of work and take plenty of notes

To keep in context on Slack, please add yourself to #week2 channel and engage, to share stories, seek help or learn from other foot nerds

Reflection questions:
- Have you dedicated 1 uninterrupted hour to your Foot Nerd Training? If no, what are the obstacles keeping you from doing that?
- Have you been able to keep your experiments simple, focused and consistent? 
- What kind of differences are your seeing/feeling in your body as a result of your experimentation?

- Did I spend a daily hour restoring foot health for all 7 days? If not, why not?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?
- Did I check in with foot nerds on Slack?
- Have I confirmed details of my week 11 workshop? If not, why not? If so, share details with other nerds on slack in the #week2 channel

Task: set a clear objective to accomplish in week 2 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

Feedback:
- How do you like the training format?
- Anything you think we should add/remove?

In week 2 we cover: 

1) Balance training
2) First principles
3) Footwear
4) Becoming a scientist
5) Choosing experiments



1 ------- BALANCE TRAINING

In a world of distractions, focus is a superpower

Balance training is 2 things: 1) focus training, 2) lower body recalibration

Training our focus is a means of training our minds to settle and direct our attention to a single task at hand

The ability to focus is key to our ability to learn, listen, and engage in deep work


Developing improved balance is really just improving lower body calibration. A calibrated lower body performs well and is resilient to injury

The ability to successfully and efficiently fight gravity is an astounding capability of the human body

Balance training is high throughput problem solving by the body

--> Input: balance challenge

--> Output: the body naturally discovers the most efficient way to organize itself against gravity and avoid falling over

Time training balance is time debugging our lower body system


By seeking efficiency, our bodies activare our hip rotator cuff

The fine precision reflexive muscles that keep the ball safely centered in the socket just like the shoulder 

I realized in clinic how much information I can get by screening someone’s single leg balance

I could see how their entire system reacted when stress tested with gravity and especially when the visual field is eliminated (eyes closed)

I also realized how many people had poor balance and how big of an obstacle poor balance was to restoring natural movement

**A note on flailing (defined: the act of waving or swinging wildly)

Flailing is exploration. It’s your body trying a new experiment: throw a limb here and see if it helps

Your body is drawing a map of the different muscles to fire when faced with a certain problem (not falling over)

The more flailing the better. Embrace it. It’s a good thing


The beam was an honest balance screen (people couldn’t cheat it) and patients found it to be a fun tool to play on

They actually enjoyed training their balance and balance improvements had huge trickle effects on movement patterns and positioning


Lack of movement and lots of chair sitting develops dark spots in the google maps version of our motor cortex

Those dark spots are unsafe to our bodies. They don't know how to stabilize there. It's where injuries happen. It's where mobility is usually reduced

Balance training is like repopulating Google maps of the motor cortex


A core requirement of Foot Nerd Training is a daily balance practice. 10 minutes everyday playing and working to develop excellent balance

How do you know you have reached a high standard of proficiency with your balance? Screen your balance. Work on it daily until you can ace the test

TEST: SL balance screen. 3/3 attempts successful in a row (barefoot, hard ground, eyes closed, single leg)



2 ------- FIRST PRINCIPLES

Thinking from first principles means starting from a foundation of what we know to be true

It means thinking for ourselves

It means understanding fundamental truths and reasoning for ourselves form that foundation

The 3 first principles that guide our thinking at TFC:

1) The body is a self healing system
2) The body is a self organizing system
3) The body adapts specifically to imposed demands (SAID principle)

3 ------- FOOTWEAR

video: (the paradox of footwear)      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd049r2CE1w

Your foot health is a direct reflection of how you use your feet

How you use your feet is primarily determined by the environment - the clothing you cover your feet with - aka the shoes you wear

I think it's helpful to clearly define two terms:

Natural footwear: Footwear that allows natural foot function (allows feet to move like feet)

Unnatural footwear: Footwear that inhibits natural foot function (prevents feet from moving like feet)

Simple really. Wear natural shoes, have healthy feet. Wear unnatural shoes, have unhealthy feet

All footwear exists on a continuum from natural to unnatural. The goal is to gradually shift away from unnatural and towards natural

Reflection/practice:
- Shoe audit: would you consider the shoes you wear to be natural or unnatural?
- Explain and write how unnatural footwear causes bunions through SAID principle

Experiment: purchase a pair of natural shoes (www.thefootcollective.store) and make them your daily drivers

Take notes on how they feel and changes you sense are happening over time



4 ------- BECOMING A SCIENTIST

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA-a9mgxVhM

Observation: Science is the grown up version of play. Treat the scientific process like a game to be played, not a problem to be solved

Practice:
- Explain the scientific method in simple terms (like you're speaking to a 10 year old)
- In 3 minutes or less, explain how you can use the scientific method to guide your journey to restore healthy feet
- Design two experiments for this week and outline them in your log (hypothesis, method, data collected, results)

5 ------- CHOOSING EXPERIMENTS

** 
[10.4.22 addition]

Words of wisdom:

Choose the area you want to work on (based on which screen was the worst/what aligns most with your primary objective)

Within the context of your chosen area, experiment broadly until you find something that works (verified by screening) and that you enjoy doing

Keep doing the thing that works until it stops working

Revisit your objective and screens

Repeat the process

BEWARE of the tendency to continually search for novel experiments that distract you away from focusing on what matters most 

Be consistent, be focused and be patient
