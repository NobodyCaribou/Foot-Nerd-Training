Welcome to week 2 of Foot Nerd Training

To keep in context on Slack, please add yourself to #week2 channel and engage 

We hope week 1 went smooth and you have been able to make good on your commitment to spend 1 focused hour everyday on your foot health
 
Complete these things everyday: 

1) Daily practice (12-30 min)
2) Take a note (5-10 min)
3) Study a concept and practice explaining it (5-10 min)


Reflection questions:
- Have I dedicated 1 daily uninterrupted hour to Foot Nerd Training? If no, what are the obstacles keeping me from doing that?
- Have I completed my daily practice everyday? 
- What kind of differences am I seeing/feeling in my body after my first 7 days?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?

Task: set a clear objective to accomplish in week 2 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)


----

In week 2 we cover: 


1) First principles [core concept #3]
2) Inputs & Outputs [core concept #4]
3) Becoming a scientist
4) Choosing experiments



1 ------- FIRST PRINCIPLES

Thinking from first principles means starting from a foundation of what we know to be true

It means thinking for ourselves

It means understanding fundamental truths and reasoning for ourselves from that foundation

The 3 first principles that guide our thinking at TFC:

1) The body is a self healing system
2) The body is a self organizing system
3) The body adapts specifically to imposed demands (SAID principle)

2 ------- Inputs & Outputs




3 ------- BECOMING A SCIENTIST

Observation: Science is the grown up version of play. Treat the scientific process like a game to be played, not a problem to be solved

Practice:
- Explain the scientific method in simple terms (like you're speaking to a 10 year old)
- In 3 minutes or less, explain how you can use the scientific method to guide your journey to restore healthy feet
- Design two experiments for this week and outline them in your log (hypothesis, method, data collected, results)

4 ------- CHOOSING EXPERIMENTS

** 
[10.4.22 addition]

Words of wisdom:

Choose the area you want to work on (based on which screen was the worst/what aligns most with your primary objective)

Within the context of your chosen area, experiment broadly until you find something that works (verified by screening) and that you enjoy doing

Keep doing the thing that works until it stops working

Revisit your objective and screens

Repeat the process

BEWARE of the tendency to continually search for novel experiments that distract you away from focusing on what matters most 

Be consistent, be focused and be patient
