Welcome to week 2 of foot nerd training

We hope your first week went smoothly and you were able to maintain your daily hour of work and take plenty of notes

To keep in context on Slack, please engage in the "#week2" channel to share stories, seek help or learn from other foot nerds

Reflection questions:
- Have you dedicated 1 uninterrupted hour to your Foot Nerd Training? If no, what are the obstacles keeping you from doing that?
- Have you been able to keep your experiments simple, focused and consistent? 
- What kind of differences are your seeing/feeling in your body as a result of your experimentation?

- Did I spend a daily hour restoring foot health for all 7 days? If not, why not?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?
- Did I check in with foot nerds on Slack?
- Have I confirmed details of my week 11 workshop? If not, why not? If so, share details with other nerds on slack in the #week2 channel

Task: set a clear objective to accomplish in week 2 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

Feedback:
- How do you like the training format?
- Anything you think we should add/remove?

In week 2 we cover: 

1) First principles
2) Footwear
3) Becoming a scientist
4) Choosing experiments



1 ------- FIRST PRINCIPLES

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF_VWaJU-HY

Practice: describe and write out the first principles related to health



2 ------- FOOTWEAR

video: (the paradox of footwear)      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd049r2CE1w

Your foot health is a direct reflection of how you use your feet

How you use your feet is primarily determined by the environment - the clothing you cover your feet with - aka the shoes you wear

I think it's helpful to clearly define two terms:

Natural footwear: Footwear that allows natural foot function (allows feet to move like feet)

Unnatural footwear: Footwear that inhibits natural foot function (prevents feet from moving like feet)

Simple really. Wear natural shoes, have healthy feet. Wear unnatural shoes, have unhealthy feet

All footwear exists on a continuum from natural to unnatural. The goal is to gradually shift away from unnatural and towards natural

Reflection/practice:
- Shoe audit: would you consider the shoes you wear to be natural or unnatural?
- Explain and write how unnatural footwear causes bunions through SAID principle

Experiment: purchase a pair of natural shoes (www.thefootcollective.store) and make them your daily drivers

Take notes on how they feel and changes you sense are happening over time



3 ------- BECOMING A SCIENTIST

video:                                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA-a9mgxVhM

Observation: Science is the grown up version of play. Treat the scientific process like a game to be played, not a problem to be solved

Practice:
- Explain the scientific method in simple terms (like you're speaking to a 10 year old)
- In 3 minutes or less, explain how you can use the scientific method to guide your journey to restore healthy feet
- Design two experiments for this week and outline them in your log (hypothesis, method, data collected, results)

4 ------- CHOOSING EXPERIMENTS

** 
[10.4.22 addition]

Words of wisdom:

Choose the area you want to work on (based on which screen was the worst/what aligns most with your primary objective)

Within the context of your chosen area, experiment broadly until you find something that works (verified by screening) and that you enjoy doing

Keep doing the thing that works until it stops working

Revisit your objective and screens

Repeat the process

BEWARE of the tendency to continually search for novel experiments that distract you away from focusing on what matters most 

Be consistent, be focused and be patient
