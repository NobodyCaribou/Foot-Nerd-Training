Welcome to week 2 of Foot Nerd Training

We hope your first week went smoothly and you were able to maintain your daily hour of work and take plenty of notes

To keep in context on Slack, please engage in the "#week2" channel to share stories, seek help or learn from other foot nerds

Reflection questions:

- Did I spend a daily hour restoring foot health for all 7 days? If not, why not?
- Did I take notes everyday? If not, why not?
- Did I check in with foot nerds on Slack?

Task: set a clear objective to accomplish in week 2 (and share it with fellow foot nerds on slack)

Feedback:
- How do you like the training format?
- Anything you think we should add/remove?

In week 2 we cover: 

1) First principles
2) Footwear
3) Becoming a scientist
4) Choosing experiments

1 ------- FIRST PRINCIPLES

2 ------- FOOTWEAR

video:                        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu7rabkg1jw

Your foot health is a direct reflection of how you use your feet

How you use your feet is primarily determined by the environment - the clothing you cover your feet with - aka the shoes you wear

Let's clearly define the two terms:

Natural footwear: Footwear that allows natural foot function (allows feet to move like feet)

Unnatural footwear: Footwear that inhibits natural foot function (stops feet from moving like feet)

Simple really. Wear natural shoes, have healthy feet. Wear unnatural shoes, have unhealthy feet

All footwear exists on a continuum from natural to unnatural. The goal is to gradually shift away from unnatural and towards natural

Reflection/practice:

- Shoe audit: would you consider the shoes you wear to be natural or unnatural?
- Explain and write how unnatural footwear causes bunions through SAID principle
- Explain the scientific method in simple terms (like you're speaking to a 10 year old)

Experiment: purchase a pair of natural shoes (www.thefootcollective.store) and make them your daily drivers

Take notes on how they feel and changes you sense are happening over time


3 ------- BECOMING A SCIENTIST

Practice:
- Design two experiments for this week and outline them in your log (hypothesis, method, data collected, results)



4 ------- CHOOSING EXPERIMENTS
